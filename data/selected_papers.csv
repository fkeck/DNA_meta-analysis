MINEROVIC_2020_18S,18S-V9 DNA metabarcoding detects the effect of water-quality impairment on stream biofilm eukaryotic assemblages,"Minerovic, Alison D.; Potapova, Marina G.; Sales, Christopher M.; Price, Jacob R.; Enache, Mihaela D.",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"DNA metabarcoding is rapidly expanding as a new approach to biodiversity assessments and biomonitoring and is especially valuable for characterizing microbial communities in aquatic habitats. When applied to eukaryotic organisms, metabarcoding is usually targeting specific taxonomic groups, such as macroinvertebrates, fungi, diatoms, or other protists. The goal of this study was to explore the potential use of metabarcoding of entire biofilm eukaryotic assemblages for the purpose of stream biomonitoring. We sampled 14 stream sites in New Jersey, USA along an impairment gradient and characterized rock biofilm assemblages using Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing of the V9 hypervariable region of 18S rDNA following the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) protocol. We also enumerated diatoms from the same samples to compare DNA metabarcoding results with morphological assessments. Among the 5866 unique rDNA sequence variants, the fungal and holozoan sequences were the most diverse, while diatom sequences were the most abundant in most sites. Among-site variability of assemblage composition was significantly higher than within-site variability of field and lab replicates, which indicates an acceptable level of reproducibility of the method. Different taxonomic groups of eukaryotes exhibited similar, but not identical patterns of assemblage variation in response to underlying environmental gradients. Both morphological and metabarcoding approaches recovered strong relationships between diatom assemblage composition and water quality impairment. Several other groups of eukaryotes, such as fungi, peronosporomycetes, green algae, and holozoans had only slightly weaker response to water quality impairment than diatoms. These findings suggest that molecular characterization of biofilm eukaryotic assemblages can be an effective tool for monitoring stream biota and its responses to disturbance even if the taxonomic assignments of sequences are only partially resolved.",2020,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106225
CAHILL_2018_ACO,A comparative analysis of metabarcoding and morphology-based identification of benthic communities across different regional seas,"Cahill, Abigail E.; Pearman, John K.; Borja, Angel; Carugati, Laura; Carvalho, Susana; Danovaro, Roberto; Dashfield, Sarah; David, Romain; Feral, Jean-Pierre; Olenin, Sergej; Siaulys, Andrius; Somerfield, Paul J.; Trayanova, Antoaneta; Uyarra, Maria C.; Chenuil, Anne",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"In a world of declining biodiversity, monitoring is becoming crucial. Molecular methods, such as metabarcoding, have the potential to rapidly expand our knowledge of biodiversity, supporting assessment, management, and conservation. In the marine environment, where hard substrata are more difficult to access than soft bottoms for quantitative ecological studies, Artificial Substrate Units (ASUs) allow for standardized sampling. We deployed ASUs within five regional seas (Baltic Sea, Northeast Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and Red Sea) for 12-26months to measure the diversity and community composition of macroinvertebrates. We identified invertebrates using a traditional approach based on morphological characters, and by metabarcoding of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. We compared community composition and diversity metrics obtained using the two methods. Diversity was significantly correlated between data types. Metabarcoding of ASUs allowed for robust comparisons of community composition and diversity, but not all groups were successfully sequenced. All locations were significantly different in taxonomic composition as measured with both kinds of data. We recovered previously known regional biogeographical patterns in both datasets (e.g., low species diversity in the Black and Baltic Seas, affinity between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean). We conclude that the two approaches provide complementary information and that metabarcoding shows great promise for marine monitoring. However, until its pitfalls are addressed, the use of metabarcoding in monitoring of rocky benthic assemblages should be used in addition to classical approaches rather than instead of them.",2018,10.1002/ece3.4283
NUNES_2019_ACO,"A comparison between the morphological and molecular approach to identify the benthic diatom community in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa","Nunes, M.; Adams, J. B.; Van Aswegen, S.; Matcher, G. F.",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,"The use of diatoms as bioindicators to detect human-induced change is a globally accepted monitoring tool. DNA metabarcoding is an effective complementary tool to standard microscopic methods for species identification, providing reliable and timeous diatom assessments in a range of aquatic ecosystems. This study evaluated the suitability of the DNA metabarcoding approach for diatom monitoring in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa. Results obtained from the standard microscopic (morphological) and molecular methods were compared and indicated a low similarity in the vegetated (11%), unvegetated (12%) and epiphytic (12%) habitats at species level for the epipelic and epiphytic diatom communities. The difference between the methods was expected given the challenges pertaining to the incomplete molecular reference database, intragenomic variability, physiological differences (number of chloroplasts) and highly variable microphytobenthos biomass. While the molecular method was unable to identify the presence of all the dominant diatom species (routinely used as ecological indicators), the available molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) provided an effective complementary tool to determine the relevant community diversity estimates required for the application of the South African estuarine health index (EHI).",2019,10.2989/1814232X.2019.1689169
AYLAGAS_2018_ADA,Adapting metabarcoding-based benthic biomonitoring into routine marine ecological status assessment networks,"Aylagas, Eva; Borja, Angel; Muxika, Inigo; Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The use of genomic approaches to assist with biodiversity estimations is an alternative to traditional biomonitoring, which is very time-consuming and costly. In response to the high demand for quick community descriptions, DNA metabarcoding can simultaneously assign taxonomy to hundreds of samples rapidly and at low cost. However, the technique has not routinely been incorporated into biomonitoring network programs yet. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding methodologies at stations within the monitoring network of the Basque Water Agency, the competent authority for the application of the European Water Framework Directive in this region. We characterized the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from 18 estuarine and coastal sediment samples using morphology and metabarcoding-based taxonomic identification and evaluated the performance of several versions of the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). Although metabarcoding detected 112 taxa against the 206 taxa identified through morphology, we showed that metabarcoding leads to similar biomonitoring conclusions compared with traditional techniques. Using the abundance and biomass of those taxa detected from morphological methodologies, we found a significant positive correlation with the number of reads obtained with metabarcoding approaches. The metabarcoding-based index derived from read counts, gAMBI, and the morphology-based index derived from individuals' biomass, (B)AMBI, showed the best correlation and revealed excellent agreement at determining the ecological status of the stations analyzed. We calculated that, for the analysis of the 51 stations included in the Basque monitoring network, metabarcoding was 55% less costly and 72% less time consuming. The results of our study are relevant to policy makers and researchers in the field of ecological assessment and will contribute to the quick implementation of DNA metabarcoding to intensive monitoring programs.",2018,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.07.044
STEYAERT_2020_ADV,Advances in metabarcoding techniques bring us closer to reliable monitoring of the marine benthos,"Steyaert, Margaux; Priestley, Victoria; Osborne, Owen; Herraiz, Alba; Arnold, Richard; Savolainen, Vincent",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Reliable and accurate biodiversity census methods are essential for monitoring ecosystem health and assessing potential ecological impacts of future development projects. Although metabarcoding is increasingly used to study biodiversity across ecological research, morphology-based identification remains the preferred approach for marine ecological impact assessments. Comparing metabarcoding to morphology-based protocols currently used by ecological surveyors is essential to determine whether this DNA-based approach is suitable for long-term monitoring of the marine ecosystems. We compared metabarcoding and morphology-based approaches for the analysis of invertebrates in low diversity intertidal marine sediment samples. We used a recently developed bioinformatics pipeline and two taxonomic assignment methods to resolve and assign amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Illumina amplicon data. We analysed the community composition recovered by both methods and tested the effects, on the levels of diversity detected by the metabarcoding method, of sieving samples prior to DNA extraction. Metabarcoding of the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene recovers the presence of more taxonomic groups than the morphological approach. We found that sieving samples results in lower alpha diversity detected and suggests a community composition that differs significantly from that suggested by un-sieved samples in our metabarcoding analysis. We found that while metabarcoding and morphological approaches detected similar numbers of species, they are unable to identify the same set of species across samples. Synthesis and applications. We show that metabarcoding using the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) marker provides a more holistic, community-based, analysis of benthic invertebrate diversity than a traditional morphological approach. We also highlight current gaps in reference databases and bioinformatic pipelines for the identification of intertidal benthic invertebrates that need to be addressed before metabarcoding can replace traditional methods. Ultimately, with these limitations taken into consideration, resolving community-wide diversity patterns with metabarcoding could improve the management of non-protected marine habitats in the United Kingdom.",2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13729
MORTAGUA_2019_APP,Applicability of DNA metabarcoding approach in the bioassessment of Portuguese rivers using diatoms,"Mortagua, Andreia; Vasselon, Valentin; Oliveira, Ricardo; Elias, Carmen; Chardon, Cecile; Bouchez, Agnes; Rimet, Frederic; Feio, Maria Joao; Almeida, Salome F. P.",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Benthic diatom communities are used in the ecological assessment of Portuguese rivers through the calculation of an autecological index, the IPS (Indice de Polluosensibilite Specifique), officially adopted for Portugal. This index requires a high level of taxonomic expertise for morphological identification of individuals at species level. Advances in genomics, such as the DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing techniques offer a promising alternative to this classical approach, decreasing expertise requirement and therefore reducing time and costs. The aim of this study was to test the potential of DNA metabarcoding of diatoms in the bioassessment of Portuguese rivers, by comparing the classifications of the IPS obtained with morphological and molecular approaches. A total of 88 samples were collected in four river types and a quality gradient in central Portugal in the spring of 2017, following the Water Framework Directive (WFD) standards. The morphological approach comprised taxonomic identification of at least 400 valves, under the light microscope. Molecular approach included eDNA extraction followed by PCR amplification and DNA high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) using a diatom-specific 312 bp rbcL DNA barcode. Sequences were analysed with Mothur software, producing Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were taxonomically assigned using the R-Syst::diatom reference library. We also tested the effect of a correction factor (CF) based on biovolume for the quantification of molecular data. When comparing the number of species identified, morphological, molecular without and with CF inventories revealed 306, 125 and 111 species, respectively. Molecular data showed 67% of unassigned OTUs. These results were mainly due to the incompleteness of the reference library, which currently represents the major difficulty in taxonomic assignment of DNA sequences in metabarcoding. Regarding IPS values, the results indicated a good correlation between morphological and molecular methods, particularly when applying the CF. Furthermore, Principal Coordinates analysis plot based on species abundances revealed a quality gradient in all 3 methodologies (morphological, molecular without and with CF). These results support the hypothesis that DNA metabarcoding is a valid approach for ecological quality assessment of Portuguese rivers. Yet, there is still work to be done on this new methodology to enable a smooth transition between the traditional and this new approach without misspend accumulated knowledge from the last decades on water quality assessment.",2019,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105470
STOECKLE_2017_AQU,Aquatic environmental DNA detects seasonal fish abundance and habitat preference in an urban estuary,"Stoeckle, Mark Y.; Soboleva, Lyubov; Charlop-Powers, Zachary",PLOS ONE,"The difficulty of censusing marine animal populations hampers effective ocean management. Analyzing water for DNA traces shed by organisms may aid assessment. Here we tested aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) as an indicator of fish presence in the lower Hudson River estuary. A checklist of local marine fish and their relative abundance was prepared by compiling 12 traditional surveys conducted between 1988-2015. To improve eDNA identification success, 31 specimens representing 18 marine fish species were sequenced for two mitochondrial gene regions, boosting coverage of the 12S eDNA target sequence to 80% of local taxa. We collected 76 one-liter shoreline surface water samples at two contrasting estuary locations over six months beginning in January 2016. eDNA was amplified with vertebrate-specific 12S primers. Bioinformatic analysis of amplified DNA, using a reference library of GenBank and our newly generated 12S sequences, detected most (81%) locally abundant or common species and relatively few (23%) uncommon taxa, and corresponded to seasonal presence and habitat preference as determined by traditional surveys. Approximately 2% of fish reads were commonly consumed species that are rare or absent in local waters, consistent with wastewater input. Freshwater species were rarely detected despite Hudson River inflow. These results support further exploration and suggest eDNA will facilitate fine-scale geographic and temporal mapping of marine fish populations at relatively low cost.",2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0175186
UCHIDA_2020_AQU,Aquatic insect community structure revealed by eDNA metabarcoding derives indices for environmental assessment,"Uchida, Noriko; Kubota, Kengo; Aita, Shunsuke; Kazama, So",PEERJ,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis provides an efficient and objective approach for monitoring and assessing ecological status; however, studies on the eDNA of aquatic insects, such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT), are limited despite its potential as a useful indicator of river health. Here, we investigated the community structures of aquatic insects using eDNA and evaluated the applicability of eDNA data for calculating assessment indices. Field surveys were conducted to sample river water for eDNA at six locations from upstream to downstream of two rivers in Japan in July and November 2016. Simultaneously, aquatic insects were collected using the traditional Surber net survey method. The communities of aquatic insects were revealed using eDNA by targeting the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene in mitochondrial DNA via metabarcoding analyses. As a result, the eDNA revealed 63 families and 75 genera of aquatic insects, which was double than that detected by the Surber net survey (especially for families in Diptera and Hemiptera). The seasonal differences of communities were distinguished by both the eDNA and Surber net survey data. Furthermore, the total nitrogen concentration, a surrogate of organic pollution, showed positive correlations with biotic environmental assessment indices (i.e., EPT index and Chironomidae index) calculated using eDNA at the genus-level resolution but the indices calculated using the Surber net survey data. Our results demonstrated that eDNA analysis with higher taxonomic resolution can provide as a more sensitive environmental assessment index than the traditional method that requires biotic samples.",2020,10.7717/peerj.9176
VASSELON_2017_ASS,"Assessing ecological status with diatoms DNA metabarcoding: Scaling-up on a WFD monitoring network (Mayotte island, France)","Vasselon, Valentin; Rimet, Frederic; Tapolczai, Kalman; Bouchez, Agnes",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Diatoms are excellent ecological indicators of water quality because they are broadly distributed, they show high species diversity and they respond rapidly to human pressures. In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) gives the legal basis for the use of this indicator for water quality assessment and its management. Several quality indices, like the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI), were developed to assess the ecological quality status of rivers based on diatom communities. It is based on morphological identifications and count of diatom species present in natural biofilms using a microscope. This methodology requires high taxonomic skills and several hours of analysis per sample as 400 individuals must be identified to species level. Since several years, a molecular approach based on DNA metabarcoding combined to High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is developed to characterize species assemblages in environmental samples which is potentially faster and cheaper. The ability of this approach to provide reliable diatom inventories has been demonstrated and its application to water quality assessment is currently being improved. Despite optimization of the DNA metabarcoding process with diatoms, few studies had yet extended it at the scale of a freshwater monitoring network and evaluated the reliability of its quality assessment compared to the classical morphological approach. In the present study we applied DNA metabarcoding to the river monitoring network of the tropical Island Mayotte. This island is a French departement since 2011 and the WFD has to be applied. This offered the opportunity to scale up the comparison of molecular and morphological approaches and their ability to produce comparable community inventories and water quality assessments. Benthic diatoms were sampled following WFD standards in 45 river sites in 2014 and 2015 (80 samples). All samples were submitted in parallel to the molecular and the morphological approaches. DNA metabarcoding was carried out using Genelute DNA extraction method, rbcL DNA barcode and PGM sequencing, while microscopic counts were carried out for the classical methodology. Diatom community structures in terms of molecular (OTUs) and of morphological (species) were significantly correlated. However, only 13% of the species was shared by both approaches, with qualitative and quantitative variation due to i) the incompleteness of the reference library (82% of morphological species are not represented in the database), ii) limits in taxonomic knowledge and iii) biases in the estimation of relative abundances linked to diatom cell biovolume. However, ecological quality status assessed with the molecular and morphological SPI values were congruent, and little affected by sequencing depth. DNA metabarcoding of diatom communities allowed a reliable estimation of the quality status for most of the rivers at the scale of the full biomonitoring network of Mayotte Island.",2017,10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.024
ELBRECHT_2017_ASS,Assessing strengths and weaknesses of DNA metabarcoding-based macroinvertebrate identification for routine stream monitoring,"Elbrecht, Vasco; Vamos, Ecaterina Edith; Meissner, Kristian; Aroviita, Jukka; Leese, Florian",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. DNA metabarcoding holds great promise for the assessment of macroinvertebrates in stream ecosystems. However, few large-scale studies have compared the performance of DNA metabarcoding with that of routine morphological identification. 2. We performed metabarcoding using four primer sets on macroinvertebrate samples from 18 stream sites across Finland. The samples were collected in 2013 and identified based on morphology as part of a Finnish stream monitoring program. Specimens were morphologically classified, following standardised protocols, to the lowest taxonomic level for which identification was feasible in the routine national monitoring. 3. DNA metabarcoding identified more than twice the number of taxa than the morphology-based protocol, and also yielded a higher taxonomic resolution. For each sample, we detected more taxa by metabarcoding than by the morphological method, and all four primer sets exhibited comparably good performance. Sequence read abundance and the number of specimens per taxon (a proxy for biomass) were significantly correlated in each sample, although the adjusted R-2 values were low. With a few exceptions, the ecological status assessment metrics calculated from morphological and DNA metabarcoding datasets were similar. Given the recent reduction in sequencing costs, metabarcoding is currently approximately as expensive as morphology-based identification. 4. Using samples obtained in the field, we demonstrated that DNA metabarcoding can achieve comparable assessment results to current protocols relying on morphological identification. Thus, metabarcoding represents a feasible and reliable method to identify macroinvertebrates in stream bioassessment, and offers powerful advantage over morphological identification in providing identification for taxonomic groups that are unfeasible to identify in routine protocols. To unlock the full potential of DNA metabarcoding for ecosystem assessment, however, it will be necessary to address key problems with current laboratory protocols and reference databases.",2017,10.1111/2041-210X.12789
HARPER_2020_ASS,Assessing the impact of the threatened crucian carp (Carassius carassius) on pond invertebrate diversity: A comparison of conventional and molecular tools,"Harper, Lynsey R.; Lawson Handley, Lori; Sayer, Carl D.; Read, Daniel S.; Benucci, Marco; Blackman, Rosetta C.; Hill, Matthew J.; Hanfling, Bernd",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Fishes stocked for recreation and angling can damage freshwater habitats and negatively impact biodiversity. The pond-associated crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is rare across Europe and is stocked for conservation management in England, but its impacts on pond biota are understudied. Freshwater invertebrates contribute substantially to aquatic biodiversity, encompassing many rare and endemic species, but their small size and high abundance complicate their assessment. Practitioners have employed sweep-netting and kick-sampling with microscopy (morphotaxonomy), but specimen size/quality and experience can bias identification. DNA and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offer alternative means of invertebrate assessment. We compared invertebrate diversity in ponds (N = 18) with and without crucian carp using morphotaxonomic identification, DNA metabarcoding and eDNA metabarcoding. Five 2L water samples and 3min sweep-net samples were collected at each pond. Inventories produced by morphotaxonomic identification of netted samples, DNA metabarcoding of bulk tissue samples and eDNA metabarcoding of water samples were compared. Alpha diversity was greatest with DNA or eDNA metabarcoding, depending on whether standard or unbiased methods were considered. DNA metabarcoding reflected morphotaxonomic identification, whereas eDNA metabarcoding produced markedly different communities. These complementary tools should be combined for comprehensive invertebrate assessment. Crucian carp presence minimally reduced alpha diversity in ponds, but positively influenced beta diversity through taxon turnover (i.e., ponds with crucian carp contained different invertebrates to fishless ponds). Crucian carp presence contributes to landscape-scale invertebrate diversity, supporting continued conservation management in England. Our results show that molecular tools can enhance freshwater invertebrate assessment and facilitate development of more accurate and ecologically effective pond management strategies.",2020,10.1111/mec.15670
PORT_2016_ASS,Assessing vertebrate biodiversity in a kelp forest ecosystem using environmental DNA,"Port, Jesse A.; O'Donnell, James L.; Romero-Maraccini, Ofelia C.; Leary, Paul R.; Litvin, Steven Y.; Nickols, Kerry J.; Yamahara, Kevan M.; Kelly, Ryan P.",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Preserving biodiversity is a global challenge requiring data on species' distribution and abundance over large geographic and temporal scales. However, traditional methods to survey mobile species' distribution and abundance in marine environments are often inefficient, environmentally destructive, or resource-intensive. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a new means to assess biodiversity and on much larger scales, but adoption of this approach for surveying whole animal communities in large, dynamic aquatic systems has been slowed by significant unknowns surrounding error rates of detection and relevant spatial resolution of eDNA surveys. Here, we report the results of a 2.5km eDNA transect surveying the vertebrate fauna present along a gradation of diverse marine habitats associated with a kelp forest ecosystem. Using PCR primers that target the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene of marine fishes and mammals, we generated eDNA sequence data and compared it to simultaneous visual dive surveys. We find spatial concordance between individual species' eDNA and visual survey trends, and that eDNA is able to distinguish vertebrate community assemblages from habitats separated by as little as similar to 60m. eDNA reliably detected vertebrates with low false-negative error rates (1/12 taxa) when compared to the surveys, and revealed cryptic species known to occupy the habitats but overlooked by visual methods. This study also presents an explicit accounting of false negatives and positives in metabarcoding data, which illustrate the influence of gene marker selection, replication, contamination, biases impacting eDNA count data and ecology of target species on eDNA detection rates in an open ecosystem.",2016,10.1111/mec.13481
GAO_2018_BIO,Bioassessment of a Drinking Water Reservoir Using Plankton: High Throughput Sequencing vs. Traditional Morphological Method,"Gao, Wanli; Chen, Zhaojin; Li, Yuying; Pan, Yangdong; Zhu, Jingya; Guo, Shijun; Hu, Lanqun; Huang, Jin",WATER,"Drinking water safety is increasingly perceived as one of the top global environmental issues. Plankton has been commonly used as a bioindicator for water quality in lakes and reservoirs. Recently, DNA sequencing technology has been applied to bioassessment. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of the 16S and 18S rRNA high throughput sequencing method (HTS) and the traditional optical microscopy method (TOM) in the bioassessment of drinking water quality. Five stations reflecting different habitats and hydrological conditions in Danjiangkou Reservoir, one of the largest drinking water reservoirs in Asia, were sampled May 2016. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed that plankton assemblages varied among the stations and the spatial patterns revealed by the two methods were consistent. The correlation between TOM and HTS in a symmetric Procrustes analysis was 0.61, revealing overall good concordance between the two methods. Procrustes analysis also showed that site-specific differences between the two methods varied among the stations. Station Heijizui (H), a site heavily influenced by two tributaries, had the largest difference while station Qushou (Q), a confluence site close to the outlet dam, had the smallest difference between the two methods. Our results show that DNA sequencing has the potential to provide consistent identification of taxa, and reliable bioassessment in a long-term biomonitoring and assessment program for drinking water reservoirs.",2018,10.3390/w10010082
CAREW_2018_CAN,Can high-throughput sequencing detect macroinvertebrate diversity for routine monitoring of an urban river?,"Carew, Melissa E.; Kellar, Claudette R.; Pettigrove, Vincent J.; Hoffmann, Ary A.",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Macroinvertebrate families identified through morphological examination have traditionally been used in routine assessment of freshwater ecosystems. However, high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) promises to improve routine assessment by providing rapid and cost-effective identification of macroinvertebrate species. In freshwater ecosystems in urbanised areas where family diversity is often low, new insights into ecosystem condition and impacting factors are likely through species-level assessments. Here we compare morphological identification to HTS based identification of macroinvertebrate families by considering 12 sites in an urban river system. Some taxa detected morphologically were not detected by HTS and vice versa. However, this had only a small impact on computed family-level metrics of ecological condition. We detected multiple species using HTS in the Chironomidae, Coenagrionidae, Hydrobiidae, Leptoceridae, Ceratopogonidae, Corixidae, Veliidae, Oligochaeta and Acarina. The highest species diversity was found in the Chironomidae, and for many of these species we had prior knowledge of their likely pollution sensitivity. In the Chironomidae, we showed that species level data was congruent with expectations based on measured levels of pollutants at sites and other family level metrics. Importantly, we also identified many species in the same family that differed in their distribution and likely pollution sensitivity in this urban river system. Therefore, HTS provided similar levels of information to traditional methods at the family level, but also generated new information for more accurate condition monitoring at the species level.",2018,10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.11.002
HAJIBABAEI_2019_COI,COI metabarcoding primer choice affects richness and recovery of indicator taxa in freshwater systems,"Hajibabaei, Mehrdad; Porter, Teresita M.; Wright, Michael; Rudar, Josip",PLOS ONE,"Mixed community or environmental DNA marker gene sequencing has become a commonly used technique for biodiversity analyses in freshwater systems. Many cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primer sets are now available for such work. The purpose of this study is to test whether COI primer choice affects the recovery of arthropod richness, beta diversity, and recovery of target assemblages in the benthos kick-net samples typically used in freshwater biomonitoring. We examine six commonly used COI primer sets on samples collected from six freshwater sites. Biodiversity analyses show that richness is sensitive to primer choice and the combined use of multiple COI amplicons recovers higher richness. Thus, to recover maximum richness, multiple primer sets should be used with COI metabarcoding. In ordination analyses based on community dissimilarity, samples consistently cluster by site regardless of amplicon choice or PCR replicate. Thus, for broadscale community analyses, overall beta diversity patterns are robust to COI marker choice. Recovery of traditional freshwater bioindicator assemblages such as Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Plectoptera, and Chironomidae as well as Arthropoda site indicators were differentially detected by each amplicon tested. This work will help future biodiversity and biomonitoring studies develop not just standardized, but optimized workflows that either maximize taxon-detection or the selection of amplicons for water quality or Arthropoda site indicators.",2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0220953
NAKAGAWA_2018_COM,Comparing local- and regional-scale estimations of the diversity of stream fish using eDNA metabarcoding and conventional observation methods,"Nakagawa, Hikaru; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Sato, Yukuto; Sado, Tetsuya; Minamoto, Toshifumi; Miya, Masaki",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. We present a performance evaluation of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding with MiFish-U/E primers to investigate local and regional diversities of stream fish species to examine potential effectiveness, limits and future remedies of this technique in large-scale monitoring. We hypothesised that eDNA inferences are more consistent with fish assemblages observed upstream than downstream due to a directional flow of river water. 2. River water was sampled at 102 sites in 51 rivers around Lake Biwa in the central part of Honshu Island, Japan, within 10 person-days, and fish species compositions inferred from eDNA and existing observational data were compared. Observation sites were chosen from the observational data that were within a certain distance (buffer range) of a water-sampling site along a river trajectory. The hypothesis of the detection bias of eDNA towards upstream assemblage was tested by comparing results with all of the observational data, data from a higher elevation and data from a lower elevation. The Jaccard dissimilarity index was plotted between the observational data and the eDNA estimates against the buffer range; the buffer range with minimum dissimilarity was chosen. 3. When using existing observational data from within 6 km upstream of the eDNA sampling sites, the eDNA results were the most consistent with the observational data and inferred 86.4% of the species reported (38/44), as well as two additional species. eDNA results also showed patterns consistent with known upstream-downstream turnover of related species and biogeographical assemblage patterns of certain species. 4. Our 10-person-days survey using the metabarcoding technique enabled us to obtain as much regional fish diversity data including the hypothesised pattern of eDNA detection with an upstream bias as the accumulated observational data obtained through greater amounts of time, money and labour. The problems regarding false-positive/negative detection were suggested in our survey; however, these should be decreased or removed by modifying the sampling methods and experimental procedures in future works. Therefore, we concluded this new tool to enable monitoring that has never been implemented, such as cross-nation, and even whole-Earth monitoring with the data at yearly, seasonal or finer temporal scales.",2018,10.1111/fwb.13094
SERRANA_2019_COM,Comparison of DNA metabarcoding and morphological identification for stream macroinvertebrate biodiversity assessment and monitoring,"Serrana, Joeselle M.; Miyake, Yo; Gamboa, Maribet; Watanabe, Kozo",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Conventional morphology-based identification is commonly used for routine assessment of freshwater ecosystems. However, cost and time efficient techniques such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) based approaches may resolve the constraints encountered in conducting morphology-based surveys. Here, we characterized stream macroinvertebrate species diversity and community composition via metabarcoding and morphological analysis from environmental samples collected from the Shigenobu River Basin in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. We compared diversity metrics and assessed both approaches' ability to evaluate the relationship between macroinvertebrate community and environmental variables. In total, we morphologically identified 45 taxa (3 families, six subfamilies, 31 genera, and five species) from 8,276 collected individuals from ten study sites. We detected 44 species by metabarcoding, with 35 species collapsed into 11 groups matching the morphologically identified taxa. A significant positive correlation between logged depth (number of HTS reads) and abundance of morphological taxa was observed, which implied that quantitative data could be used for subsequent analyses. We recovered a considerably high rate of relative abundance detection of the morphologically identified samples. Recovery of samples by incidence or presence/absence count were considerably low, with a high rate of false-negative detection specifically for species with scarce representation in the community sample. Given the low taxonomic resolution of the morphological assignment in this study, we report that metabarcoding does not reflect the majority of the species naturally occurring in our site, which could further be proven by performing refined morphological assessment of the samples. However, abundance-based detection proved to be efficient with 92% of the individuals correctly demonstrated. We conclude that DNA metabarcoding provides a practical and cost-effective approach especially for rapid biological monitoring of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities, but further improvements in the detection of scarce samples should be considered to increase the sensitivity of detecting most, if not all, of the species present in the environment.",2019,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.008

A.; Clarke, Laurence J.; Wedderburn, Scotte D.; Barnes, Thomas C.; Weyrich, Laura S.; Cooper, Alan",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Regular biological surveys are essential for informed management of freshwater ecosystems. However, current morphology-based biodiversity surveys can be invasive, time-consuming, and financially expensive. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing has been suggested as an alternative non-invasive, time- and cost-effective biological survey tool. However, eDNA sequencing tools require experimental validation in natural ecosystems before confidence in their use can be assumed. In this study, we compare fish community data obtained via eDNA metabarcoding to that of conventional fyke netting within two complex and drought-prone river systems. We also compare different eDNA sampling strategies and genetic markers for detecting rare and threatened fish species. We were able to detect 100% of the fyke net caught-species from eDNA when appropriate sampling strategies were used, including threatened and invasive species. Specifically, we found that two 1 L water samples per site were insufficient for detecting less abundant taxa; however, five 1 L samples per site enabled a 100% detection rate. Further, sampling eDNA from the water column appeared to be more effective for detecting fish communities than eDNA from sediments. However, on a per site basis, community discrepancies existed between the two methods, highlighting the benefits and limitations of both approaches. We demonstrate that careful interpretation of eDNA data is crucial as bioinformatic identification of sequences, without logical inference or local knowledge, can lead to erroneous conclusions. We discuss these discrepancies and provide recommendations for fish eDNA metabarcoding surveys. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.03.010

Recently, along with the advancement of monitoring techniques, metabarcoding has been widely used in the context of environmental DNA (eDNA). We examine the applicability of eDNA metabarcoding for effective monitoring and assessment of community composition, compared with conventional observation using microscopic identification in a coastal ecosystem, Gwangynag Bay in South Korea. Our analysis is based primarily on two surveys at a total of 15 study sites in early and late summer (June and September) of the year 2018. The results of our study demonstrate the similarity and dissimilarity of biological communities in composition, richness and diversity between eDNA metabarcoding and conventional microscopic identification. It is found that, overall, eDNA metabarcoding appears to provide a wider variety of species composition, while conventional microscopic identification depicts more distinct plankton communities in sites. Finally, we suggest that eDNA metabarcoding is a practically useful method and can be potentially considered as a valuable alternative for biological monitoring and diversity assessments.",2019,10.3390/app9163272
CASTANEDA_2020_DET,Detecting Native Freshwater Fishes Using Novel Non-invasive Methods,"Castaneda, Rowshyra A.; Van Nynatten, Alexander; Crookes, Steven; Ellender, Bruce R.; Heath, Daniel D.; MacIsaac, Hugh J.; Mandrak, Nicholas E.; Weyl, Olaf L. F.",FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Improving the ability to detect and quantify rare freshwater fishes in remote locations is of growing conservation concern, as the distributions of many native fishes are contracting to such locations where there are reduced anthropogenic and invasive species pressures. However, conventional sampling methods, e.g., backpack electrofishing and seines, tend to be heavy and bulky, thereby making them difficult to transport into remote areas with no road access. These conventional sampling methods also require physical handling of fishes, which may cause stress, harm, and mortality-all undesirable side effects for rare fishes. Thus, visual observation methods, such as underwater camera and snorkel surveys, and environmental DNA (eDNA), that are easily transportable and do not require physical handling of fishes, are being more frequently used in freshwater ecosystems. However, there have been few studies on the relative effectiveness of these three methods for detecting and quantifying freshwater fishes. In this study, the species-specific detection probabilities between the three methods, and abundance estimates derived from the visual observation methods were compared, and their utility for sampling rare fishes in remote locations in South Africa was evaluated. Underwater cameras and snorkel surveys detected slightly different species within a fish community. For the redfins, the detection probability using underwater cameras (0.96, SD = 0.03) was highest, followed by snorkel surveys (0.93, SD = 0.05), and eDNA (0.70, SD = 0.21). The visual observation methods were positively correlated with pool length, while eDNA was negatively correlated with turbidity. For Cape Kurper, the detection probability using underwater cameras (0.75, SD = 0.15) was highest, followed by snorkel surveys (0.68, SD = 0.16), and eDNA (0.64, SD = 0.19); all three methods were negatively affected by water turbidity. It is recommended that decisions on which sampling method to use in remote locations should depend on whether the study requires population- or community-level information, spatial scale required, and resource availability, as each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Generally, eDNA is the most expensive method and requires specialized facilities and equipment, while underwater cameras require video analyses that are more time consuming to analyze than snorkel surveys.",2020,10.3389/fenvs.2020.00029
THOMSEN_2012_DET,Detection of a Diverse Marine Fish Fauna Using Environmental DNA from Seawater Samples,"Thomsen, Philip Francis; Kielgast, Jos; Iversen, Lars Lonsmann; Moller, Peter Rask; Rasmussen, Morten; Willerslev, Eske",PLOS ONE,"Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human over-exploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from 1/2-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0041732

To avoid diversity loss, it is necessary to monitor biological communities, and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has been developed as a rapid, noninvasive, and cost-effective method for aquatic biodiversity monitoring. Although this method has been applied to various environments and taxa, a detailed assessment of the efficient sampling methods for monitoring is still required. In this study, we explored eDNA metabarcoding sampling methods for fish at a single site to maximize the number of detected species using realistic effort in a natural, small river. We considered the following three parameters: sample type (water or sediment), sample position at a site (right and left shore and center of the river), and water volume (10-4000 mL). The results suggested that the number of detected species from sedimentary eDNA was equivalent to that from aqueous eDNA, although the species composition was different. The number of detected species could be saturated by collecting a 1000 mL water sample, regardless of sampling position within a survey site. However, sedimentary eDNA showed a spatially heterogeneous species composition between sampling positions within a survey site despite the short distance (5 m) between positions, without apparent differences in physical properties such as velocity and sediment particle distribution. By completing eDNA biodiversity monitoring of fish with 1000 mL water samples across the whole river, we detected more fish species than in previous traditional surveys conducted at the same sites. Thus, the aqueous eDNA metabarcoding method is as efficient as traditional surveys, while sedimentary eDNA metabarcoding could complement the results of aqueous eDNA metabarcoding.",2020,10.1007/s10201-020-00645-9

This traditional approach is also time-consuming. Diatom metabarcoding is a promising alternative and there is increasing interest in using this approach for routine assessment. However, until now, analysis protocols for diatom metabarcoding have been developed and optimised by research groups working in isolation. The diversity of existing bioinformatics methods highlights the need for an assessment of the performance and comparability of results of different methods. The aim of this study was to test the correspondence of outputs from six bioinformatics pipelines currently in use for diatom metabarcoding in different European countries. Raw sequence data from 29 biofilm samples were treated by each of the bioinformatics pipelines, five of them using the same curated reference database. The outputs of the pipelines were compared in terms of sequence unit assemblages, taxonomic assignment, biotic index score and ecological assessment outcomes. The three last components were also compared to outputs from traditional light microscopy, which is currently accepted for ecological assessment of phytobenthos, as required by the Water Framework Directive. We also tested the performance of the pipelines on the two DNA markers (rbcL and 185-V4) that are currently used by the working groups participating in this study. The sequence unit assemblages produced by different pipelines showed significant differences in terms of assigned and unassigned read numbers and sequence unit numbers. When comparing the taxonomic assignments at genus and species level, correspondence of the taxonomic assemblages between pipelines was weak. Most discrepancies were linked to differential detection or quantification of taxa, despite the use of the same reference database. Subsequent calculation of biotic index scores also showed significant differences between approaches, which were reflected in the final ecological assessment. Use of the rbcL marker always resulted in better correlation among molecular datasets and also in results closer to these generated using traditional microscopy. This study shows that decisions made in pipeline design have implications for the dataset's structure and the taxonomic assemblage, which in turn may affect biotic index calculation and ecological assessment. There is a need to define best-practice bioinformatics parameters in order to ensure the best representation of diatom assemblages. Only the use of similar parameters will ensure the compatibility of data from different working groups. The future of diatom metabarcoding for ecological assessment may also lie in the development of new metrics using, for example, presence/absence instead of relative abundance data.

Alongside with traditional morphological analyses, metabarcoding has become a valuable tool to study the community structures of various organisms, including diatoms. Here, we test whether the quantity of sediment sample used for DNA extraction affects the results obtained from high-throughput sequencing (metabarcoding) of the diatom rbcL region by isolating DNA from 10 g and 0.5 g (wet weight) of lake surface sediment samples. Because bioinformatics processing of metabarcoding data may affect the outcome, we also tested the consistency of the results from three different pipelines: 1) ESVs (exact sequence variants) pipeline; 2) clustering sequences at 95% sequence identity to form OTUs (operational taxonomic units; 95% OTUs); and 3) 97% OTUs pipeline. Additionally, the agreement between metabarcoding data and morphological inventories of corresponding samples were compared. Our results demonstrate highly uniform patterns between the diatom rbcL amplicons from 10 g and 0.5 g of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) extracts (HTS 10 and HTS 0.5, respectively). Furthermore, after the careful curation of the sequencing data, metabarcoding results were highly consistent among the data sets produced by different bioinformatics pipelines. Comparing results from metabarcoding and microscopy, we identified some taxonomic mismatches: morphological analyses identified 59 diatom genera, whereas metabarcoding 49 to 54 genera. These mismatches are related to incompleteness of the sequence databases, but also to inconsistencies in diatom taxonomy in general and potential dissolution effects of diatom valves caused by high alkalinity of the investigated lake waters. Nevertheless, multivariate community analysis revealed consistent results between data sets identified by microscopy and metabarcoding - water depth and conductivity as the most significant variables in driving diatom communities in Lake Nam Co - further confirming that metabarcoding is a viable method for identifying diatom-environment relationships.",2021,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107070

Compared to other regions, chromophytic phytoplankton are considerably understudied in the Bay of Bengal (BOB). Here, we investigated community structure and spatial distribution of chromophytic phytoplankton in the BOB by using RuBisCO genes (Form ID rbcL). High throughput sequencing of rbcL genes revealed that diatoms, cyanobacteria (Cyanophyceae), Pelagophyceae, Haptophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Eustigamatophyceae, Xanthophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Dictyochophyceae, and Pinguiophyceae were the most abundant groups recovered in the BOB. Abundances and distribution of diatoms and Pelagophyceae were further verified using quantitative PCR analyses which showed the dominance of these groups near the Equator region (p < 0.01) where upwelling was likely the source of nutrients. Further, redundancy analysis demonstrated that temperature was an important environmental driver in structuring distributions of Cyanophyceae and dominant chromophytic phytoplankton. Morphological identification and quantification confirmed the dominance of diatoms, and also detected other cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates that were missing in our molecular characterizations. Pearson's correlations of these morphologically identified phytoplankton with environmental gradients also indicated that nutrients and temperature were key variables shaping community structure. Combination of molecular characterization and morphological identification provided a comprehensive overview of chromophytic phytoplankton.

Depending on their design and placement, stormwater ponds can act as both refugia and traps for local biodiversity. To evaluate the impact of stormwater ponds on biodiversity, it is critical to use effective and precise methods for identification of life associated with the water body. DNA metabarcoding has recently become a promising tool for identification and assessment of freshwater biodiversity. Using both morphology and DNA metabarcoding, we analyze species richness and biological composition of samples from 12 stormwater ponds and investigate the impact of pond size and pollution levels in the sediments and water column on the macroinvertebrate community structure. DNA metabarcoding captured and identified more than twice the number of taxa compared to morphological identification. The (dis)similarity of macroinvertebrate community composition in different ponds showed that the ponds appear better separated in the results obtained by DNA metabarcoding, but that the explained variation is higher for the results obtained by morphologically identification, since it provides abundance data. The reliance on morphological methods has limited our perception of the aquatic biodiversity in response to anthropogenic stressors, thereby providing inaccurate information for appropriate design and management of stormwater ponds; these drawbacks can be overcome by DNA metabarcoding. Synthesis and applications. The results indicate that DNA metabarcoding is a useful tool in identifying species, especially Diptera, which are difficult to determine. Application of DNA metabarcoding greatly increases the number of species identified at each sampling site, thereby providing a more accurate information regarding the way the ponds function and how they are affected by management.

They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.",2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0195770

We do this by comparing the similarity of DNA metabarcoding and morphologically derived macroinvertebrate metrics (i.e. richness, % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, % chironomid), and the ability of DNA metabarcoding and morphological metrics to detect key gradients in stream condition linked to forested watershed features. Our results show consistency between methods, where common DNA metabarcoding and morphological macroinvertebrate metrics are positively correlated and indicate the same key gradients in stream condition (i.e. dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and conductivity) linked to watershed size and shifts in forest composition across watersheds.

Here we report a combination of experimental and field studies to assess the aptitude of COI metabarcoding to provide robust species-level identifications for high-throughput monitoring of estuarine macrobenthos. To investigate the ability of metabarcoding to detect all species present in bulk DNA extracts, we contrived three phylogenetically diverse communities, and applied four different primer pairs to generate PCR products within the COI barcode region. Between 78-83% of the species in the contrived communities were recovered through HTS. Subsequently, we compared morphology and metabarcoding-based approaches to determine the species composition from four distinct estuarine sites. Our results indicate that species richness would be considerably underestimated if only morphological methods were used: globally 27 species identified through morphology versus 61 detected by metabarcoding. Although further refinement is required to improve efficiency and output of this approach, here we show the great aptitude of COI metabarcoding to provide high quality and auditable species identifications in estuarine macrobenthos monitoring.",2017,10.1038/s41598-017-15823-6

A.; Geiger, Matthias F.; Leese, Florian",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"DNA metabarcoding of macroinvertebrates is increasingly used for aquatic bioassessment and -monitoring. A major strength of metabarcoding is the high taxonomic resolution provided while the inability to deliver reliable abundance data is regarded a main drawback. Data on the potential of metabarcoding to disentangle site-specific and seasonal variation with presence/absence data have been poorly explored. In addition, the robustness of ecological status assessments compliant with the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EG) have only been compared in few studies, none of which adressed changes across seasons. Therefore, we here investigated seasonal as well as site-specific effects on macroinvertebrate communities at six river sites in a nearnatural (Sieg) and urban (Emscher) German river through metabarcoding. Furthermore, we evaluated the usability of the method for ecological status assessments. Our data showed distinct seasonal effects on OTU composition at the near-natural river Sieg. However, ecological status assessment was constant through seasons and comparable to assessments based on available morphological identification. In contrast to the river Sieg, we found strong site and stressor-specific impacts in the heterogeneous urban river Emscher. Here, ecological status assessment varied between sampling sites ranging from good to bad status but was largely consistent between seasons. Our study demonstrates the ability of presence/absence metabarcoding data to reliably assess invertebrate community composition in streams and infer environmental (natural or anthropogenic) impacts. Together with the technical robustness, our study encourages the wider adoption of the technique in stream bioassessment and -monitoring.",2020,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106383
RIMET_2018_DOW,Do we similarly assess diversity with microscopy and high-throughput sequencing? Case of microalgae in lakes,"Rimet, Frederic; Vasselon, Valentin; A-Keszte, Barbara; Bouchez, Agnes",ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION,"Diatoms are a species-diverse phylum of microalgae often presenting high biomass in aquatic habitats. This makes them excellent ecological indicators in rivers and lakes. They are routinely used to assess ecological quality of rivers and lakes using microscopy, which is time consuming. An alternative is to determine species in samples based on short DNA barcodes and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Former studies showed that community structure and water quality assessments based on diatoms deliver similar results with both methods. But, none evaluated if diversities were assessed in the same way despite the importance of this ecological metric. Based on littoral benthic samplings carried out in 56 pristine alpine lakes, we compared different diversity indices measured with microscopy and metabarcoding. Each lake was sampled in three different places of its littoral. We showed that alpha (diversity measured in a single sampling site of a given lake) and I' (total diversity in a lake where three independent samples were considered) diversities obtained with HTS were higher than those obtained with microscopy. This may be explained by the capacity of HTS to detect morphologically cryptic species and to better detect rare taxa. On the other hand, beta diversity obtained with HTS was smaller, which may be explained by the capacity of HTS to detect very rare species and free-floating extracellular DNA. Nevertheless, diversity indices obtained with both methodologies were well correlated each other. This study validates the possibility to assess diatom diversity with HTS in a comparable way to the classical microscopic analysis.",2018,10.1007/s13127-018-0359-5

Previous studies monitoring the ecological effects of SBT operations on downstream reaches suggest a positive influence of SBTs on riverbed sediment conditions and macroinvertebrate communities based on traditional morphology-based surveys. Morphology-based macroinvertebrate assessments are costly and time-consuming, and the large number of morphologically cryptic, small-sized and undescribed species usually results in coarse taxonomic identification. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding analysis to assess the influence of SBT operations on macroinvertebrates downstream of SBT outlets by estimating species diversity and pairwise community dissimilarity between upstream and downstream locations in dam-fragmented rivers with operational SBTs in comparison to dam-fragmented (i.e., no SBTs) and free-flowing rivers (i.e., no dam). We found that macroinvertebrate community dissimilarity decreases with increasing operation time and frequency of SBTs. These factors of SBT operation influence changes in riverbed features, e.g. sediment relations, that subsequently effect the recovery of downstream macroinvertebrate communities to their respective upstream communities. Macroinvertebrate abundance using morphologically-identified specimens was positively correlated to read abundance using metabarcoding. This supports and reinforces the use of quantitative estimates for diversity analysis with metabarcoding data.",2018,10.1038/s41598-018-28624-2

Previous studies have evaluated optimal strategies, at several experimental steps of eDNA metabarcoding, for the simultaneous detection of fish species. However, optimal sampling strategies, especially the season and the location of water sampling, have not been evaluated thoroughly. To identify optimal sampling seasons and locations, we performed sampling monthly or at two-monthly intervals throughout the year in three dam reservoirs. Water samples were collected from 15 and nine locations in the Miharu and Okawa dam reservoirs in Fukushima Prefecture, respectively, and five locations in the Sugo dam reservoir in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. One liter of water was filtered with glass-fiber filters, and eDNA was extracted. By performing MiFish metabarcoding, we successfully detected a total of 21, 24, and 22 fish species in Miharu, Okawa, and Sugo reservoirs, respectively. From these results, the eDNA metabarcoding method had a similar level of performance compared to conventional long-term data. Furthermore, it was found to be effective in evaluating entire fish communities. The number of species detected by eDNA survey peaked in May in Miharu and Okawa reservoirs, and in March and June in Sugo reservoir, which corresponds with the breeding seasons of many of fish species inhabiting the reservoirs. In addition, the number of detected species was significantly higher in shore, compared to offshore samples in the Miharu reservoir, and a similar tendency was found in the other two reservoirs. Based on these results, we can conclude that the efficiency of species detection by eDNA metabarcoding could be maximized by collecting water from shore locations during the breeding seasons of the inhabiting fish. These results will contribute in the determination of sampling seasons and locations for fish fauna survey via eDNA metabarcoding, in the future.",2020,10.1002/ece3.6279

Here we applied the eDNA methodology concurrent with conventional detection techniques during two routine monitoring seasons to detect the presence of three invasive fish in Australia with contrasting spatial distributions (benthopelagic, pelagic and benthic): common carp (Cyprinus carpio), redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis) and Oriental weatherloach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). Our objectives were to compare the seasonal detection of the target species using eDNA and conventional detection (fyke nets), determine the relationship between catch per unit effort (CPUE) and DNA copy number and ascertain the best water location (surface vs. subsurface) for eDNA detection. Our results show that eDNA had a higher detection rate than fyke nets for Oriental weatherloach and redfin perch during both the autumn and spring surveys. Common carp was detected at all sites for both seasons using fyke nets and eDNA with the exception of one site during the autumn survey where common carp was captured using fyke nets but no carp eDNA was detected. Season had a significant effect on DNA concentration for common carp (P <.005) and Oriental weatherloach (P=.002) but sampling location (surface vs. subsurface) had no significant effect on DNA concentration for all three species. We found a positive correlation between CPUE and DNA copy number for Oriental weatherloach (r(s) = .718, alpha =.045) and redfin perch (r(s) =.756, alpha =.030) during spring but a non-significat, negative trend was observed for common carp in both seasons (r(s) = -. 357, alpha =.385 spring; rho = -. 539, alpha =.168 autumn). Our results show that eDNA is an effective tool for the detection of single or multiple species to complement the traditional approaches using physical capture. As with all survey methods, the eDNA approach suffers from imperfect detection. We conclude that eDNA survey results are more powerful when used in conjunction with other survey methods as a way to enhance detection rates and increase confidence in the monitoring results.",2017,10.3391/mbi.2017.8.1.09

We tested whether a single PCR survey of eDNA in seawater using a broad metazoan primer could identify differences in community composition between five adjacent habitats at 19 sites across a tropical Caribbean bay in Panama. We paired this effort with visual fish surveys to compare methods for a conspicuous taxonomic group. eDNA revealed a tremendous diversity of animals (8,586 operational taxonomic units), including many small taxa that would be undetected in traditional in situ surveys. Fish comprised only 0.07% of the taxa detected by a broad COI primer, yet included 43 species not observed in the visual survey. eDNA revealed significant differences in fish and invertebrate community composition across adjacent habitats and areas of the bay driven in part by taxa known to be habitat-specialists or tolerant to wave action. Our results demonstrate the ability of broad eDNA surveys to identify biodiversity patterns in the ocean.",2020,10.1038/s41598-020-63565-9

Traditional fisheries assessments that rely on capture of organisms often underestimate true species richness. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an alternative tool that infers species richness by collecting and sequencing DNA present in the ecosystem. Our objective was to determine how spatial distribution of samples and “bioinformatic stringency” affected eDNA-metabarcoding estimates of species richness compared with capture-based estimates in a 2.2 ha reservoir. When bioinformatic criteria required species to be detected only in a single sample, eDNA metabarcoding detected all species captured with traditional methods plus an additional 11 noncaptured species. However, when we required species to be detected with multiple markers and in multiple samples, eDNA metabarcoding detected only seven of the captured species. Our analysis of the spatial patterns of species detection indicated that eDNA was distributed relatively homogeneously throughout the reservoir, except near the inflowing stream. We suggest that interpretation of eDNA metabarcoding data must consider the potential effects of water body type, spatial resolution, and bioinformatic stringency.",2017,10.1139/cjfas-2016-0306
MAITLAND_2020_FRE,Freshwater diatom biomonitoring through benthic kick-net metabarcoding,"Maitland, Victoria Carley; Robinson, Chloe Victoria; Porter, Teresita M.; Hajibabaei, Mehrdad",PLOS ONE,"Biomonitoring is an essential tool for assessing ecological conditions and informing management strategies. The application of DNA metabarcoding and high throughput sequencing has improved data quantity and resolution for biomonitoring of taxa such as macroinvertebrates, yet, there remains the need to optimise these methods for other taxonomic groups. Diatoms have a longstanding history in freshwater biomonitoring as bioindicators of water quality status. However, multi-substrate periphyton collection, a common diatom sampling practice, is time-consuming and thus costly in terms of labour. This study examined whether the benthic kick-net technique used for macroinvertebrate biomonitoring could be applied to bulk-sample diatoms for metabarcoding. To test this approach, we collected samples using both conventional multi-substrate microhabitat periphyton collections and bulk-tissue kick-net methodologies in parallel from replicated sites with different habitat status (good/fair). We found there was no significant difference in community assemblages between conventional periphyton collection and kick-net methodologies or site status, but there was significant difference between diatom communities depending on site (P = 0.042). These results show the diatom taxonomic coverage achieved through DNA metabarcoding of kick-net is suitable for ecological biomonitoring applications. The shift to a more robust sampling approach and capturing diatoms as well as macroinvertebrates in a single sampling event has the potential to significantly improve efficiency of biomonitoring programmes that currently only use the kick-net technique to sample macroinvertebrates.",2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0242143
KELLY_2017_GEN,Genetic and Manual Survey Methods Yield Different and Complementary Views of an Ecosystem,"Kelly, Ryan P.; Closek, Collin J.; O'Donnell, James L.; Kralj, James E.; Shelton, Andrew O.; Samhouri, Jameal F.",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"Given the rapid rise of environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys in ecology and environmental science, it is important to be able to compare the results of these surveys to traditional methods of measuring biodiversity. Here we compare samples from a traditional method (a manual tow-net) to companion eDNA samples sequenced at three different genetic loci. We find only partial taxonomic overlap among the resulting datasets, with each reflecting a portion of the larger suite of taxa present in the sampled nearshore marine environment. In the larger context of eDNA sequencing surveys, our results suggest that primer amplification bias drives much of the taxonomic bias in eDNA detection, and that the baseline probability of detecting any given taxon with a broad-spectrum primer set is likely to be low. Whether catching fish with different nets or using different PCR primer sets, multiple data types can provide complementary views of a common ecosystem. However, it remains difficult to cross-validate eDNA sequencing techniques in the field, either for presence/absence or for abundance, particularly for primer sets that target very wide taxonomic ranges. Finally, our results highlight the breadth of diversity in a single habitat, and although eDNA does capture a richer sample of the community than traditional methods of sampling, a large number of eDNA primer sets focusing on different subsets of the biota would be necessary to survey any ecological community in a reasonably comprehensive way.",2017,10.3389/fmars.2016.00283

A.; Zimmermann, H. H.; Davydova, P.; Biskaborn, B. K.; Shevtsova, I; Stoof-Leichsenring, K. R.",JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY,"Lakes cover large parts of the climatically sensitive Arctic landscape and respond rapidly to environmental change. Arctic lakes have different origins and include the predominant thermokarst lakes, which are small, young and highly dynamic, as well as large, old and stable glacial lakes. Freshwater diatoms dominate the primary producer community in these lakes and can be used to detect biotic responses to climate and environmental change. We used specific diatom metabarcoding on sedimentary DNA, combined with next-generation sequencing and diatom morphology, to assess diatom diversity in five glacial and 15 thermokarst lakes within the easternmost expanse of the Siberian treeline ecotone in Chukotka, Russia. We obtained 163 verified diatom sequence types and identified 176 diatom species morphologically. Although there were large differences in taxonomic assignment using the two approaches, they showed similar high abundances and diversity of Fragilariceae and Aulacoseiraceae. In particular, the genetic approach detected hidden within-lake variations of fragilarioids in glacial lakes and dominance of centric Aulacoseira species, whereas Lindavia ocellata was predominant using morphology. In thermokarst lakes, sequence types and valve counts also detected high diversity of Fragilariaceae, which followed the vegetation gradient along the treeline. Ordination analyses of the genetic data from glacial and thermokarst lakes suggest that concentrations of sulfate (SO42-), an indicator of the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes under anoxic conditions, and bicarbonate (HCO3-), which relates to surrounding vegetation, have a significant influence on diatom community composition. For thermokarst lakes, we also identified lake depth as an important variable, but SO42- best explains diatom diversity derived from genetic data, whereas HCO3- best explains the data from valve counts. Higher diatom diversity was detected in glacial lakes, most likely related to greater lake age and different edaphic settings, which gave rise to diversification and endemism. In contrast, small, dynamic thermokarst lakes are inhabited by stress-tolerant fragilarioids and are related to different vegetation types along the treeline ecotone. Our study demonstrated that genetic investigations of lake sediments can be used to interpret climate and environmental responses of diatoms. It also showed how lake type affects diatom diversity, and that such genetic analyses can be used to track diatom community changes under ongoing warming in the Arctic.",2020,10.1007/s10933-020-00133-1

Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an effective and non-invasive method, which can provide semi-quantitative information about fish communities in large lakes. This study further investigated the potential of fish-based eDNA metabarcoding as a tool for lake assessment by collecting and analysing water samples from eight Welsh lakes and six meres in Cheshire, England, with well-described fish faunas. Water samples (N=252) were assayed using two mitochondrial DNA regions (Cytb and 12S rRNA). eDNA sampling indicated the presence of very similar species in the lakes compared to those expected on the basis of existing and historical information. Firstly, 24 species were detected, with a total of 111 species occurrences in the lakes studied using eDNA. Secondly, there was a significant positive correlation between expected faunas and eDNA data in terms of confidence of species occurrence (Spearman's r=0.74, df=109, p<0.001). Thirdly, eDNA data can estimate relative abundance with the standard five-level classification scale (DAFOR'). Lastly, four ecological fish communities were characterized using eDNA data which agree with the predefined lake types according to environmental characteristics.Synthesis and applications. There are some limitations when using conventional captured-based methods for surveying species richness and relative abundance, such as morphological identification bias, difficulties in recording small-bodied, rare and/or elusive species and destructive impacts on the environment. This study provides further evidence that environmental DNA metabarcoding outperforms other captured-based survey techniques in a wide range of lake types for community-level analysis whether in species detection, relative abundance estimate using the standard five-level classification scale or characterization ecological fish communities.

Our ability to sustainably manage this expansive habitat is impeded by our poor understanding of its inhabitants and by the difficulties in surveying and monitoring these areas. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has great potential to improve our understanding of this region and to facilitate monitoring across a broad range of taxa. Here, we evaluate two eDNA sampling protocols and seven primer sets for elucidating fish diversity from deep sea water samples. We found that deep sea water samples (> 1400 m depth) had significantly lower DNA concentrations than surface or mid-depth samples necessitating a refined protocol with a larger sampling volume. We recovered significantly more DNA in large volume water samples (1.5 L) filtered at sea compared to small volume samples (250 mL) held for lab filtration. Furthermore, the number of unique sequences (exact sequence variants; ESVs) recovered per sample was higher in large volume samples. Since the number of ESVs recovered from large volume samples was less variable and consistently high, we recommend the larger volumes when sampling water from the deep ocean. We also identified three primer sets which detected the most fish taxa but recommend using multiple markers due the variability in detection probabilities and taxonomic resolution among fishes for each primer set. Overall, fish diversity results obtained from metabarcoding were comparable to conventional survey methods. While eDNA sampling and processing need be optimized for this unique environment, the results of this study demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding can facilitate biodiversity surveys in the deep ocean, require less dedicated survey effort per unit identification, and are capable of simultaneously providing valuable information on other taxonomic groups.",2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0236540

In assessments based on freshwater macroinvertebrates, a key challenge is that DNA is often extracted from cleaned, sorted and homogenized bulk samples, which is time-consuming and may be incompatible with sample preservation requirements of regulatory agencies. Here, we optimize and evaluate metabarcoding procedures based on DNA recovered from 96% ethanol used to preserve field samples and thus including potential PCR inhibitors and nontarget organisms. We sampled macroinvertebrates at five sites and subsampled the preservative ethanol at 1 to 14 days thereafter. DNA was extracted using column-based enzymatic (TISSUE) or mechanic (SOIL) protocols, or with a new magnetic-based enzymatic protocol (BEAD), and a 313-bp COI fragment was amplified. Metabarcoding detected at least 200 macroinvertebrate taxa, including most taxa detected through morphology and for which there was a reference barcode. Better results were obtained with BEAD than SOIL or TISSUE, and with subsamples taken 7-14 than 1-7 days after sampling, in terms of DNA concentration and integrity, taxa diversity and matching between metabarcoding and morphology. Most variation in community composition was explained by differences among sites, with small but significant contributions of subsampling day and extraction method, and negligible contributions of extraction and PCR replication. Our methods enhance reliability of preservative ethanol as a potential source of DNA for macroinvertebrate metabarcoding, with a strong potential application in freshwater biomonitoring.",2019,10.1111/1755-0998.13012

Traditional benthic monitoring relying on morphotaxonomic inventories of macrofaunal communities is expensive, time-consuming and expertise-demanding. High-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA barcodes (metabarcoding) offers an alternative to describe biological communities. However, whether the metabarcoding approach meets the quality standards of benthic monitoring remains to be tested. Here, we compared morphological and eDNA/RNA-based inventories of metazoans from samples collected at 10 stations around a fish farm in Scotland, including near-cage and distant zones. For each of 5 replicate samples per station, we sequenced the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene using the Illumina technology. After filtering, we obtained 841,766 metazoan sequences clustered in 163 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). We assigned the OTUs by combining local BLAST searches with phylogenetic analyses. We calculated two commonly used indices: the Infaunal Trophic Index and the AZTI Marine Biotic Index. We found that the molecular data faithfully reflect the morphology-based indices and provides an equivalent assessment of the impact associated with fish farms activities. We advocate that future benthic monitoring should integrate metabarcoding as a rapid and accurate tool for the evaluation of the quality of marine benthic ecosystems.",2015,10.1038/srep13932

Results from 32 ponds inside and outside Kruger National Park, South Africa show that our primer detected mosquito eDNA. However, it yielded only a subset of the species found using adult trapping methods. Particularly the less frequent and container-breeding species were not found. Our approach provides the first steps toward an eDNA-based method to assess the entire community of larval-stage mosquitoes. It may thereby overcome current taxonomic hurdles presented by morphological identification of larvae. As such, it holds great promise for biomonitoring and ecological studies of mosquitoes.",2019,10.3389/fevo.2019.00260

Advances have been made in the field of metabarcoding, but challenges remain when using complex samples. Uneven biomass distributions, preferential amplification and reference database deficiencies can all lead to discrepancies between morphological and DNA-based taxa lists. The effects of different taxonomic groups on these issues remain understudied. By metabarcoding WFD monitoring samples, we analyzed six different taxonomic groups of freshwater organisms, both separately and combined. Identifications based on metabarcoding data were compared directly to morphological assessments performed under the WFD. The diversity of taxa for both morphological and DNA-based assessments was similar, although large differences were observed in some samples. The overlap between the two taxon lists was 56.8% on average across all taxa, and was highest for Crustacea, Heteroptera, and Coleoptera, and lowest for Annelida and Mollusca. Taxonomic sorting in six basic groups before DNA extraction and amplification improved taxon recovery by 46.5%. The impact on ecological quality ratio (EQR) scoring was considerable when replacing morphology with DNA-based identifications, but there was a high correlation when only replacing a single taxonomic group with molecular data. Different taxonomic groups provide their own challenges and benefits. Some groups might benefit from a more consistent and robust method of identification. Others present difficulties in molecular processing, due to uneven biomass distributions, large genetic diversity or shortcomings of the reference database. Sorting samples into basic taxonomic groups that require little taxonomic knowledge greatly improves the recovery of taxa with metabarcoding. Current standards for EQR monitoring may not be easily replaced completely with molecular strategies, but the effectiveness of molecular methods opens up the way for a paradigm shift in biomonitoring.",2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0226527

There are limited eDNA studies that evaluate vertebrate biodiversity in the marine environment or compare patterns of biodiversity with traditional methods. This study uses eDNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA genes present in seawater samples to characterize vertebrate biodiversity and distribution within National Marine Sanctuaries located in the California Current upwelling ecosystem. The epipelagic community in the study region has been monitored using traditional (mid-water trawl and marine mammal) survey methods since 1983. During 2016 and 2017, we concurrently sampled the epipelagic community using traditional survey methods and water for eDNA analysis to assess agreement among the methods. We collected replicate eDNA samples from 25 stations at depths of 10, 40, and 80 m, resulting in 131 small volume (1 L) environmental water samples to examine eDNA sequences. Across the eDNA and traditional survey methods, 80 taxa were identified. Taxa identified by eDNA partially overlapped with taxa through trawl and marine mammal surveys, but more taxa were identified by eDNA. Diversity and distribution patterns of marine vertebrates inferred from eDNA sequences reflected known spatial distribution patterns in species occurrence and community structure (e.g., cross-shelf and alongshore patterns). During both years, we identified fishery taxa Sebastes (rockfish), Merluccius (hake), Citharichthys (sanddab), and Engraulis (anchovy) across the majority of the stations using eDNA metabarcoding. The marine vertebrate assemblage identified by eDNA in 2016 was statistically different from the 2017 assemblage and more marine mammals were identified in 2017 than in 2016. Differences in assemblages identified by eDNA were coincident with different oceanographic conditions (e.g., upwelling and stratification). In 2016, weak upwelling and warmer than average conditions were measured, and vertebrate assemblages were not different among ecological regions [Point Reyes, Pescadero, and Monterey Bay]. While in 2017, average upwelling conditions returned, vertebrate assemblages differed at each region.

DNA metabarcoding has emerged as having potential to provide speedy assessment of community structure from environmental samples. Here we tested the reliability of metabarcoding by comparing morphological and molecular inventories of invertebrate communities associated with sea-grasses through estimates of alpha and beta diversity, as well as the identification of the most abundant taxa. Sediment samples were collected from six Zostera marina seagrass meadows across Brittany, France. Metabarcoding surveys were performed using both mitochondrial (Cytochrome Oxidase I) and nuclear (small subunit 18S ribosomal RNA) markers, and compared to morphological inventories compiled by a long-term benthic monitoring network. A sampling strategy was defined to enhance performance and accuracy of results by preventing the dominance of larger animals, boosting statistical support through replicates, and using two genes to compensate for taxonomic biases. Molecular barcodes proved powerful by revealing a remarkable level of diversity that vastly exceeded the morphological survey, while both surveys identified congruent differentiation of the meadows. However, despite the addition of individual barcodes of common species into taxonomic reference databases, the retrieval of only 36% of these species suggest that the remaining were either not present in the molecular samples or not detected by the molecular screening. This finding exemplifies the necessity of comprehensive and well-curated taxonomic reference libraries and multi-gene surveys. Overall, results offer methodological guidelines and support for metabarcoding as a powerful and repeatable method of characterizing communities, while also presenting suggestions for improvement, including implementation of pilotstudies prior to performing full “blind” metabarcoding assessments to optimize sampling and amplification protocols.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0117562
LAROCHE_2017_MET,Metabarcoding monitoring analysis: the pros and cons of using co-extracted environmental DNA and RNA data to assess offshore oil production impacts on benthic communities,"Laroche, Olivier; Wood, Susanna A.; Tremblay, Louis A.; Lear, Gavin; Ellis, Joanne I.; Pochon, Xavier",PEERJ,"Sequencing environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used as an alternative to traditional morphological-based identification to characterize biological assemblages and monitor anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. Most studies only assess eDNA which, compared to eRNA, can persist longer in the environment after cell death. Therefore, eRNA may provide a more immediate census of the environment due to its relatively weaker stability, leading some researchers to advocate for the use of eRNA as an additional, or perhaps superior proxy for portraying ecological changes. A variety of pre-treatment techniques for screening eDNA and eRNA derived operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have been employed prior to statistical analyses, including removing singleton taxa (i.e., OTUs found only once) and discarding those not present in both eDNA and eRNA datasets. In this study, we used bacterial (16S ribosomal RNA gene) and eukaryotic (18S ribosomal RNA gene) eDNA- and eRNA-derived data from benthic communities collected at increasing distances along a transect from an oil production platform (Taranaki, New Zealand). Macro-infauna (visual classification of benthic invertebrates) and physico-chemical data were analyzed in parallel. We tested the effect of removing singleton taxa, and removing taxa not present in the eDNA and eRNA libraries from the same environmental sample (trimmed by shared OTUs), by comparing the impact of the oil production platform on alpha- and beta-diversity of the eDNA/eRNA-based biological assemblages, and by correlating these to the morphologically identified macro-faunal communities and the physico-chemical data. When trimmed by singletons, presence/absence information from eRNA data represented the best proxy to detect changes on species diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes. However, assessment of quantitative beta-diversity from read abundance information of bacteria eRNA did not, contrary to eDNA, reveal any impact from the oil production activity. Overall, the data appeared more robust when trimmed by shared OTUs, showing a greater effect of the platform on alpha-and beta-diversity. Trimming by shared OTUs likely removes taxa derived from legacy DNA and technical artefacts introduced through reverse transcriptase, polymerase-chain-reaction and sequencing. Findings from our scoping study suggest that metabarcoding-based biomonitoring surveys should, if funds, time and expertise allow, be assessed using both eDNA and eRNA products.",2017,10.7717/peerj.3347

The implementation of biofouling monitoring programs allows for better fouling management and also for the early identification of NIS. However, few monitoring studies have used recent methods, such as metabarcoding, that can significantly enhance the detection of those species. Here, we employed monthly monitoring of biofouling growth on stainless steel plates in the Atlantic Port of Leixoes (Northern Portugal), over one year to test the effect of commercial anti-corrosion paint in the communities. Fouling organisms were identified by combining morpho-taxonomy identification with community DNA metabarcoding using multiple markers (16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 23S rRNA, and COI genes). The dominant colonizers found at this location were hard foulers, namely barnacles and mussels, while other groups of organisms such as cnidarians, bryozoans, and ascidians were also abundant. Regarding the temporal dynamics of the fouling communities, there was a progressive increase in the colonization of cyanobacteria, green algae, and red algae during the sampled period with the replacement of less abundant groups. The tested anticorrosion paint demonstrated to have a significant prevention effect against the biofouling community resulting in a biomass reduction.

We analysed composition of lake and catchment vegetation and vascular plant eDNA at 11 lakes in northern Norway. Out of 489 records of taxa growing within 2 m from the lake shore, 170-49% (mean 31%) of the identifiable taxa recorded were detected with eDNA. Of the 217 eDNA records of 47 plant taxa in the 11 lakes, 73% and 12% matched taxa recorded in vegetation surveys within 2 m and up to about 50 m away from the lakeshore, respectively, whereas 16% were not recorded in the vegetation surveys of the same lake. The latter include taxa likely overlooked in the vegetation surveys or growing outside the survey area. The percentages detected were 61, 47, 25, and 15 for dominant, common, scattered, and rare taxa, respectively. Similar numbers for aquatic plants were 88, 88, 33 and 62%, respectively. Detection rate and taxonomic resolution varied among plant families and functional groups with good detection of e.g. Ericaceae, Roseaceae, deciduous trees, ferns, club mosses and aquatics. The representation of terrestrial taxa in eDNA depends on both their distance from the sampling site and their abundance and is sufficient for recording vegetation types. For aquatic vegetation, eDNA may be comparable with, or even superior to, in-lake vegetation surveys and may therefore be used as an tool for biomonitoring. For reconstruction of terrestrial vegetation, technical improvements and more intensive sampling is needed to detect a higher proportion of rare taxa although DNA of some taxa may never reach the lake sediments due to taphonomical constrains.

Research indicates that eDNA is an effective tool for monitoring fishery resources. This study analyzed the seasonal variations in fish resources in the Yangtze Estuary, China, using eDNA. A total of 103 water samples were collected from the Yangtze Estuary across the four seasons in 2019-20 samples in February, 28 in May, 28 in August and 27 in November. Our research successfully detected the fishery resources of the Yangtze Estuary. We found significant differences according to the season. The results showed that 59 species were identified in 2019 (20 in February, 16 in May, 5 in August and 45 in November) and fish species varied widely over the four seasons. Furthermore, our samples revealed significant differences in annual fish stocks in the Yangtze Estuary, compared with eDNA data from 2018 and with traditional surveys from past years.

MAECHLER_2014_UTI,Utility of environmental DNA for monitoring rare and indicator macroinvertebrate species,"Maechler, Elvira; Deiner, Kristy; Steinmann, Patrick; Altermatt, Florian",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Accurate knowledge of the distribution of rare, indicator, or invasive species is required for conservation and management decisions. However, species monitoring done with conventional methods may have limitations, such as being laborious in terms of cost and time, and often requires invasive sampling of specimens. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been identified as a molecular tool that could overcome these limitations, particularly in aquatic systems. Detection of rare and invasive amphibians and fish in lake and river systems has been effective, but few studies have targeted macroinvertebrates in aquatic systems. We expanded eDNA techniques to a broad taxonomic array of macroinvertebrate species in river and lake systems. We were able to detect 5 of 6 species (Ancylus fluviatilis, Asellus aquaticus, Baetis buceratus, Crangonyx pseudogracilis, and Gammarus pulex) with an eDNA method in parallel to the conventional kicknet-sampling method commonly applied in aquatic habitats. Our eDNA method showed medium to very high consistency with the data from kicknet-sampling and was able to detect both indicator and nonnative macroinvertebrates. Furthermore, our primers detected target DNA in concentrations down to 10(-5) ng/mu L of total extracted tissue DNA in the absence of background eDNA in the reaction. We demonstrate that an eDNA surveillance method based on standard PCR can deliver biomonitoring data across a wide taxonomic range of macroinvertebrate species (Gastropoda, Isopoda, Ephemeroptera, and Amphipoda) in riverine habitats and may offer the possibility to deliver data on a more refined time scale than conventional methods when focusing on single or few target species. Such information based on nondestructive sampling may allow rapid management decisions and actions.",2014,10.1086/678128

Monitoring marine biodiversity in such habitats is, however, challenging as it typically involves expensive, non-standardized, and often destructive sampling methods that limit its scalability. Differences in monitoring approaches furthermore hinders inter-comparison among monitoring programs. Here, we announce a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) consisting of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) with the aim to assess the status and changes in benthic fauna with genomic-based methods, notably DNA metabarcoding, in combination with image-based identifications. This article presents the results of a 30-month pilot phase in which we established an operational and geographically expansive ARMS-MBON. The network currently consists of 20 observatories distributed across European coastal waters and the polar regions, in which 134 ARMS have been deployed to date. Sampling takes place annually, either as short-term deployments during the summer or as long-term deployments starting in spring. The pilot phase was used to establish a common set of standards for field sampling, genetic analysis, data management, and legal compliance, which are presented here. We also tested the potential of ARMS for combining genetic and image-based identification methods in comparative studies of benthic diversity, as well as for detecting non-indigenous species. Results show that ARMS are suitable for monitoring hard-bottom environments as they provide genetic data that can be continuously enriched, re-analyzed, and integrated with conventional data to document benthic community composition and detect non-indigenous species. Finally, we provide guidelines to expand the network and present a sustainability plan as part of the European Marine Biological Resource Centre (www.embrc.eu).",2020,10.3389/fmars.2020.572680

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to study communities of microorganisms, so we carried out a test of the reliability of 454 pyrosequencing for estimating diatom inventories in environmental samples. We used small subunit ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (SSU rDNA), ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) markers and examined reference libraries to define thresholds between the intra-and interspecific and intra-and intergeneric genetic distances. Based on tests of 1 mock community, we used a threshold of 99% identity for SSU rDNA and rbcL sequences to study freshwater diatoms at the species level. We applied 454 pyrosequencing to 4 contrasting environmental samples (with one in duplicate), assigned taxon names to environmental sequences, and compared the qualitative and quantitative molecular inventories to those obtained by microscopy. Species richness detected by microscopy was always higher than that detected by pyrosequencing. Some morphologically detected taxa may have been persistent frustules from dead cells. Some taxa detected by molecular analysis were not detected by morphology and vice versa. The main source of divergence appears to be inadequate taxonomic coverage in DNA reference libraries. Only a small percentage of species (but almost all genera) in morphological inventories were included in DNA reference libraries. DNA reference libraries contained a smaller percentage of species from tropical (27.1-38.1%) than from temperate samples (53.7-77.8%). Agreement between morphological and molecular inventories was better for species with relative abundance > 1% than for rare species. The rbcL marker appeared to provide more reproducible results (94.9% species similarity between the 2 duplicates) and was very useful for molecular identification, but procedural standardization is needed. The water-quality ranking assigned to a site via the Pollution Sensitivity diatom index was the same whether calculated with molecular or morphological data. Pyrosequencing is a promising approach for detecting all species, even rare ones, once reference libraries have been developed.",2014,10.1086/675079

A.; Hanner, Robert H.; Cottenie, Karl",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Freshwater biomonitoring programmes routinely sample aquatic macroinvertebrates. These samples are time-consuming to collect, as well as challenging and costly to identify reliably genus or species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has emerged as a surrogate to traditional collection techniques and has been used in whole-community approaches across several taxa and ecosystems. However, the usefulness of eDNA-based detection of freshwater macroinvertebrates has not been extensively explored. Few studies have directly compared bulk sample and eDNA metabarcoding at a local scale to assess how effective each method is at characterizing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Here, we collected both eDNA and kicknet samples at the same sample transect locations across nine different streams in southern Ontario, Canada. We observed minimal overlap in community composition between these paired samples. Bulk tissue metabarcoding resulted in a greater proportion of sequences belonging to metazoan taxa (over 99%) than eDNA (12%) and had higher OTU richness for macroinvertebrate taxa. We suggest that degenerate primers are not effective for eDNA metabarcoding due to the high degree of nontarget amplification and subsequently low yield of target DNA. While both bulk sample and eDNA metabarcoding had the power to detect differences between stream communities, eDNA did not represent local communities. Bulk tissue metabarcoding thus provides a more accurate representation of local stream macroinvertebrate communities and is the preferred method if smaller-scale spatial resolution is an important factor in data analyses.",2020,10.1111/mec.15597

Yet, visual morphology, traditionally and widely used for species identification in coastal and marine ecosystem communities, is tedious and entails limitations. Metabarcoding coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) represents an alternative to rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively analyze thousands of environmental samples simultaneously, and this method is increasingly used to characterize the metazoan taxonomic composition of a wide variety of environments. However, a comprehensive study benchmarking visual and metabarcoding-based taxonomic inferences that validates this technique for environmental monitoring is still lacking. Here, we compare taxonomic inferences of benthic macroinvertebrate samples of known taxonomic composition obtained using alternative metabarcoding protocols based on a combination of different DNA sources, barcodes of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and amplification conditions. Our results highlight the influence of the metabarcoding protocol in the obtained taxonomic composition and suggest the better performance of an alternative 313 bp length barcode to the traditionally 658 bp length one used for metazoan metabarcoding. Additionally, we show that a biotic index inferred from the list of macroinvertebrate taxa obtained using DNA-based taxonomic assignments is comparable to that inferred using morphological identification. Thus, our analyses prove metabarcoding valid for environmental status assessment and will contribute to accelerating the implementation of this technique to regular monitoring programs.",2016,10.3389/fmars.2016.00096

Present and future international biosecurity directives can be accomplished only if the biota acquired by maritime traffic in ports is controlled.

In this study, we employed an extremely simplified environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology from only three 1-L bottles of water per port, followed by metabarcoding (high-throughput sequencing and DNA-based species identification) using 18S rDNA and Cytochrome oxidase I as genetic barcodes. Eight Bay of Biscay ports with available inventory of fouling invertebrates were employed as a case study. Despite minimal sampling efforts, three invasive invertebrates were detected: the barnacle Austrominius modestus, the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the polychaete Polydora triglanda. The same species have been previously found from visual and DNA barcoding (genetic identification of individuals) surveys in the same ports.

Here we tested the possibility to overcome these limitations using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to identify and quantify diatoms found in environmental DNA and RNA samples. We analyzed 27 river sites in the Geneva area (Switzerland), in order to compare the values of the Swiss Diatom Index (DI-CH) computed either by microscopic quantification of diatom species or directly from NGS data.

Recent studies suggest that aquatic biofilms can physically act as sorptive sponges of DNA. We took the opportunity from already available samples of stone biofilms and macroinvertebrates specimens collected in parallel at the same sites to test the capacity of biofilms to act as DNA samplers of macroinvertebrate communities in streams. Macroinvertebrate communities are usually studied with metabarcoding using the DNA extracted from their bodies bulk samples, which remains a time-consuming approach and involves the destruction of all individual specimens from the samples. The ability of biofilms to capture DNA was explored on 19 rivers sites of a tropical island (Mayotte Island, France). First, macroinvertebrate specimens were identified based on their morphological characteristics. Second, DNA was extracted from biofilms, and macroinvertebrate communities were targeted using a standard COI barcode. The resulting morphological and molecular inventories were compared. They provided comparable structures and diversities for macroinvertebrate communities when one is working with the unassigned OTU data. After taxonomic assignment of the OTU data, diversity and richness were no longer correlated. The ecological assessment derived from morphological bulk samples was conserved by the biofilms samples. We also showed that the biofilm method allows to detect a higher diversity for some organisms (Cnidaria), that is hardly accessible with the morphological method. The results of this study exploring the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms are encouraging. However, a more detailed study integrating more replicates and comparing the biodiversity signal based on both morphological and molecular bulk macroinvertebrale samples to the one captured by biofilms will be necessary. Better understanding how the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms represents the biodiversity of a given sampling site is necessary before considering its use for bioassessment applications.

A major obstacle in the assessment of diversity is the lack of consistency between patterns assessed by molecular and morphological data. This work aims to reconcile the two in a single richness measure, to investigate the environmental drivers affecting this measure, and finally to predict its spatio-temporal patterns. Location and time period This is a global scale study, based on data collected within the 2009-2013 interval during theTaraOceans expedition. Major taxa studied The focus of this study is diatoms. They play an important role in several biogeochemical cycles and within marine food webs, and display high taxonomic and functional richness. Methods We integrate measures of diatom richness across the global ocean using molecular and morphological approaches, giving particular attention to `the rare biosphere'. We then perform a machine-learning-based analysis of these reconciled patterns to extrapolate diatom richness at the global scale and to identify the main environmental processes governing it. Finally, we model the response of diatom richness to climate change. Results By filtering out 0.3% of the rarest operational taxonomic units, molecular-based richness patterns show the best possible match with the morphological approach. Temperature, phosphate, chlorophyllaand the Lyapunov exponent are the major explainers of these reconciled patterns. Global scale predictions provide a first approximation of the global geography of diatom richness and of the possible impacts of climate change. Main conclusions Our models suggest that diatom richness is controlled by different processes characteristic of distinct environmental scenarios: lateral mixing in highly dynamic regions, and both nutrient availability and temperature elsewhere. We present herein the effects of these processes on richness and how these same effects differ from other diversity indices because of the main component of richness: the rare biosphere.",2020,10.1111/geb.13161

However, the choice of the taxonomic marker as well as the methodology for data analysis differ between these studies, hampering the comparison of their results and effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare two taxonomic markers commonly used in diatom metabarcoding and three distinct analytical approaches to infer a molecular diatom index. We used the values of classical morphological diatom index as a benchmark for this comparison. We amplified and sequenced both a fragment of the rbcL gene and the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene for 112 epilithic samples from Swiss and French rivers. We inferred index values using three analytical approaches: by computing it directly from taxonomically assigned sequences, by calibrating de novo the ecovalues of all metabarcodes, and by using a supervised machine learning algorithm to train predictive models. In general, the values of index obtained using the two “taxonomy-free” approaches, encompassing molecular assignment and machine learning, were closer correlated to the values of the morphological index than the values based on taxonomically assigned sequences. The correlations of the three analytical approaches were higher in the case of rbcL compared to the 18S marker, highlighting the importance of the reference database which is more complete for the rbcL marker.

Of critical consideration when designing experiments, and especially so when developing community standards and legislative frameworks, is the choice of genetic marker and primer set. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), the standard DNA barcode marker for animals, with its extensive reference library, taxonomic discriminatory power and predictable sequence variation, is the natural choice for many metabarcoding applications. However, for targeting specific taxonomic groups in environmental samples, the utility of COI has yet to be fully scrutinized. Here, by using a case study of marine and freshwater fishes from the British Isles, we quantify the in silico performance of twelve primer pairs from four mitochondrial loci - COI, cytochrome b, 12S and 16S - in terms of reference library coverage, taxonomic discriminatory power and primer universality. We subsequently test in vitro four primer pairs - three COI and one 12S - for their specificity, reproducibility, and congruence with independent datasets derived from traditional survey methods at five estuarine and coastal sites around the English Channel and North Sea. Our results show that for aqueous extra-organismal DNA at low template concentrations, both metazoan-targeted and fish-targeted COI primers perform poorly in comparison to 12S, exhibiting low levels of reproducibility due to non-specific amplification of prokaryotic and non-target eukaryotic DNAs. An ideal metabarcode would have an extensive reference library upon which custom primers could be designed, either for broad assessments of biodiversity, or taxon specific surveys. Such a database is available for COI, but low primer specificity hinders practical application, while conversely, 12S primers offer high specificity, but lack adequate references. The latter, however, can be mitigated by expanding the concept of DNA barcodes to include whole mitochondrial genomes generated by genome-skimming existing tissue collections.",2019,10.1111/2041-210X.13276

In Denmark, water quality assessments of streams are often estimated according to the Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI). The conventional DSFI method is time consuming and requires highly specialized expertise for species identification of the relevant indicator invertebrates. Furthermore, conventional species identification of relevant indicators may be hampered by differences in, or lack of, developmental stages or due to damages during the sampling process. Metabarcoding has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with conventional morphology-based species identification. Using high-throughput DNA sequencing, metabarcoding of invertebrates collected from stream water provides an alternative to the expertise of taxonomic experts. The present study applies metabarcoding using universal invertebrate primers targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene to determine stream water qualifies. The obtained community profiles were compared to conventional water quality assessments according to the Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI). Multivariate data analysis of obtained sequences resulted in distinct clusters of taxonomic units, which reflected the stream water quality as defined by the DSFI.

Recently, several attempts have been made to use eDNA metabarcoding as an alternative tool. However, until now, most applied metabarcoding studies have been based on the taxonomic assignment of sequences that provides reference to morphospecies ecology. Usually, only a small portion of metabarcoding data can be used due to a limited reference database and a lack of phylogenetic resolution. Here, we investigate the possibility to overcome these limitations using a taxonomy-free approach that allows the computing of a molecular index directly from eDNA data without any reference to morphotaxonomy. As a case study, we use the benthic diatoms index, commonly used for monitoring the biological quality of rivers and streams. We analysed 87 epilithic samples from Swiss rivers, the ecological status of which was established based on the microscopic identification of diatom species. We compared the diatom index derived from eDNA data obtained with or without taxonomic assignment. Our taxonomy-free approach yields promising results by providing a correct assessment for 77% of examined sites. The main advantage of this method is that almost 95% of OTUs could be used for index calculation, compared to 35% in the case of the taxonomic assignment approach. Its main limitations are under-sampling and the need to calibrate the index based on the microscopic assessment of diatoms communities. However, once calibrated, the taxonomy-free molecular index can be easily standardized and applied in routine biomonitoring, as a complementary tool allowing fast and cost-effective assessment of the biological quality of watercourses.",2017,10.1111/1755-0998.12668

In marine ecosystems, plankton surveys using the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) have characterized biodiversity along transects covering millions of kilometres with time-series spanning decades. We investigated the potential for use of metabarcoding in CPR surveys. Samples (n = 53) were collected in two Southern Ocean transects and metazoans identified using standard microscopic methods and by high-throughput sequencing of a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker. DNA increased the number of metazoan species identified and provided high-resolution taxonomy of groups problematic in conventional surveys (e.g., larval echinoderms and hydrozoans). Metabarcoding also generally produced more detections than microscopy, but this sensitivity may make cross-contamination during sampling a problem. In some samples, the prevalence of DNA from large plankton such as krill masked the presence of smaller species. We investigated adding a fixed amount of exogenous DNA to samples as an internal control to allow determination of relative plankton biomass. Overall, the metabarcoding data represent a substantial shift in perspective, making direct integration into current long-term time-series challenging. We discuss a number of hurdles that exist for progressing DNA metabarcoding from the current snapshot studies to the requirements of a long-term monitoring programme. Given the power and continually increasing efficiency of metabarcoding, it is almost certain this approach will play an important role in future plankton monitoring.",2018,10.1111/1755-0998.12740

We analysed 1,716 multimethod replicates at a basin scale to measure the taxonomic and functional diversity of Mediterranean fish assemblages. Taxonomic identities were investigated at species, genus and family levels. Functional identities were assessed using combinations of morphological, behavioural and trophic traits. We show that: (a) SSFc provided the higher taxonomic diversity estimates followed by eDNA, and then UVCt and BUV; (b) eDNA was the only method able to gather the whole spectrum of considered functional traits, showing the most functionally diversified and least redundant fish assemblages; and (c) the effectiveness of eDNA in describing functional structure reflected its lack of selectivity towards any considered functional trait.

FUJII_2019_ENV,Environmental DNA metabarcoding for fish community analysis in backwater lakes: A comparison of capture methods,"Fujii, Kazuya; Doi, Hideyuki; Matsuoka, Shunsuke; Nagano, Mariko; Sato, Hirotoshi; Yamanaka, Hiroki",PLOS ONE,"The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for community analysis has recently been developed. High-throughput parallel DNA sequencing (HTS), called eDNA metabarcoding, has been increasingly used in eDNA studies to examine multiple species. However, eDNA metabarcoding methodology requires validation based on traditional methods in all natural ecosystems before a reliable method can be established. To date, relatively few studies have performed eDNA metabarcoding of fishes in aquatic environments where fish communities were intensively surveyed using multiple traditional methods. Here, we have compared fish communities' data from eDNA metabarcoding with seven conventional multiple capture methods in 31 backwater lakes in Hokkaido, Japan. We found that capture and field surveys of fishes were often interrupted by macrophytes and muddy sediments in the 31 lakes. We sampled 1 L of the surface water and analyzed eDNA using HTS. We also surveyed the fish communities using seven different capture methods, including various types of nets and electrofishing. At some sites, we could not detect any eDNA, presumably because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition. We also detected the marine fish species as sewage-derived eDNA. Comparisons of eDNA metabarcoding and capture methods showed that the detected fish communities were similar between the two methods, with an overlap of 70%. Thus, our study suggests that to detect fish communities in backwater lakes, the performance of eDNA metabarcoding with the use of 1 L surface water sampling is similar to that of capturing methods. Therefore, eDNA metabarcoding can be used for fish community analysis but environmental factors that can cause PCR inhibition, should be considered in eDNA applications.",2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0210357

To validate the reliability of the metabarcoding approach, we compare the taxonomic resolution obtained using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) Thini-barcode' and nuclear 18S small ribosomal subunit (18S) V1-V2 region, with traditional morphology-based identification of Xenacoelomorpha and Nematoda. Location: 30 samples were analysed from two ecologically distinct locations along the west coast of Sweden. 18 replicate samples of coarse shell sand were collected along the northeastern side of Hallo island near Smogen, while 12 replicate samples of soft mud were collected in the Gullmarn Fjord near Lysekil. Methods: Meiofauna was extracted using flotation and siphoning methods. Both COI and 18S regions were amplified from total DNA samples using Metazoan specific primers and subsequently sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, producing in total 24 132 875 paired-end reads of 300 bp in length, of which 15 883 274 COI reads and 8 249 601 18S reads. These were quality filtered resulting in 7 954 017 COI sequences and 890 370 18S sequences, clustered into 2805 and 1472 representative OTUs respectively, yielding 190 metazoan OTUs for COI and 121 metazoan OTUs for 18S using a 97% sequence similarity threshold. Results: The Metazoan fraction represents 7% of the total dataset for COI (190 OTUs) and 8% of sequences for 18S (121 OTUs). Annelida (30% of COI metazoan OTUs and 23.97% of 18S metazoan OTUs) and Arthropoda (27.37% of COI metazoan OTUs and 11.57% of 18S metazoan OTUs), were the most OTU rich phyla identified in all samples combined. As well as Annelida and Arthropoda, other OTU rich phyla represented in our samples include Mollusca, Platyhelminthes and Nematoda. In total, 213 COI OTUs and 243 18S OTUs were identified to species using a 97% sequence similarity threshold, revealing some non-native species and highlighting the potential of metabarcoding for biological recording. Taxonomic community composition shows as expected clear differentiation between the two habitat types (soft mud versus coarse shell sand), and diversity observed varies according to choice of meiofaunal sampling method and primer pair used.",2017,10.3897/BDJ.5.e12731

Using an eDNA metabarcoding approach, we regularly sampled 500 km of a large river (Rhone River). Comparisons with long-term electrofishing surveys demonstrated the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to qualitatively and quantitatively reveal fish assemblage structures (relative species abundance) but eDNA integrated a larger space than the classical sampling location. Combination of a literature review and field data showed that eDNA behaves in the water column like fine particulate organic matter. Its detection distance varied from a few km in a small stream to more than 100 km in a large river.

BACHY_2013_ACC,Accuracy of protist diversity assessments: morphology compared with cloning and direct pyrosequencing of 18S rRNA genes and ITS regions using the conspicuous tintinnid ciliates as a case study,"Bachy, Charles; Dolan, John R.; Lopez-Garcia, Purificacion; Deschamps, Philippe; Moreira, David",ISME JOURNAL,"Deep-sequencing technologies are becoming nearly routine to describe microbial community composition in environmental samples. The 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) pyrosequencing has revealed a vast diversity of infrequent sequences, leading to the proposition of the existence of an extremely diverse microbial 'rare biosphere'. Although rare microbes no doubt exist, critical views suggest that many rare sequences may actually be artifacts. However, information about how diversity revealed by molecular methods relates to that revealed by classical morphology approaches is practically nonexistent. To address this issue, we used different approaches to assess the diversity of tintinnid ciliates, a species-rich group in which species can be easily distinguished morphologically. We studied two Mediterranean marine samples with different patterns of tintinnid diversity. We estimated tintinnid diversity in these samples employing morphological observations and both classical cloning and sequencing and pyrosequencing of two different markers, the 18S rDNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, applying a variety of computational approaches currently used to analyze pyrosequence reads. We found that both molecular approaches were efficient in detecting the tintinnid species observed by microscopy and revealed similar phylogenetic structures of the tintinnid community at the species level. However, depending on the method used to analyze the pyrosequencing results, we observed discrepancies with the morphology-based assessments up to several orders of magnitude. In several cases, the inferred number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) largely exceeded the total number of tintinnid cells in the samples. Such inflation of the OTU numbers corresponded to 'rare biosphere' taxa, composed largely of artifacts. Our results suggest that a careful and rigorous analysis of pyrosequencing data sets, including data denoising and sequence clustering with well-adjusted parameters, is necessary to accurately describe microbial biodiversity using this molecular approach.

A.; Zakharov, Evgeny V.",APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) using high-throughput sequencing has rapidly emerged as a method to detect organisms from environmental samples. However, eDNA studies of aquatic biomes have focused on surveillance of animal species with less emphasis on plants. Pondweeds are important bioindicators of freshwater ecosystems, although their diversity is underestimated due to difficulties in morphological identification and monitoring. METHODS: A protocol was developed to detect pondweeds in water samples using atpB-rbcL and ITS2 markers. The water samples were collected from the Grand River within the rare Charitable Research Reserve, Ontario (RARE). Short fragments were amplified using primers targeting pondweeds, sequenced on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, and assigned to the taxonomy using a local DNA reference library and GenBank. RESULTS: We detected two species earlier documented at the experimental site during ecological surveys (Potamogeton crispus and Stuckenia pectinata) and three species new to the RARE checklist (P. foliosus, S. filiformis, and Zannichellia palustris). DISCUSSION: Our targeted approach to track the species composition of pondweeds in freshwater ecosystems revealed underestimation of their diversity. This result suggests that eDNA is an effective tool for monitoring plant diversity in aquatic habitats.",2018,10.1002/aps3.1155

D.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Aquatic oligochaete communities are valuable indicators of the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes, but identification of specimens to the species level based on morphological features requires solid expertise in taxonomy and is possible only for a fraction of specimens present in a sample. The identification of aquatic oligochaetes using DNA barcodes would facilitate their use in biomonitoring and allow a wider use of this taxonomic group for ecological diagnoses. Previous approaches based on DNA metabarcoding of samples composed of total sediments or pools of specimens have been proposed for assessing the biological quality of ecosystems, but such methods do not provide precise information on species abundance, which limits the value of resulting ecological diagnoses. Here, we tested how a DNA barcoding approach based on high-throughput sequencing of sorted and genetically tagged specimens performed to assess oligochaete species diversity and abundance and the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes. We applied both molecular and morphological approaches at 13 sites in Swiss streams and at 7 sites in Lake Geneva. We genetically identified 33 or 66 specimens per site. For both approaches, we used the same index calculations. We found that the ecological diagnoses derived from the genetic approach matched well with those of the morphological approach and that the genetic identification of only 33 specimens per site provided enough ecological information for correctly estimating the biological quality of sediments in streams and lakes.",2020,10.1038/s41598-020-58703-2

The analysis of current spatial variability within such lakes increases our understanding of the origin and establishment of biodiversity. The environmental sensitivity and the high taxonomic richness of diatoms make them ideal organisms to investigate intra-lake variability. We investigated modern intra-lake diatom diversity in the large and old sub-arctic Lake Bolshoe Toko in Siberia. Our study uses diatom-specific metabarcoding, applying a short rbcL marker combined with next-generation sequencing and morphological identification to analyse the diatom diversity in modern sediment samples of 17 intra-lake sites. We analysed abundance-based compositional taxonomic diversity and generic phylogenetic diversity to investigate the relationship of diatom diversity changes with water depth. The two approaches show differences in taxonomic identification and alpha diversity, revealing a generally higher diversity with the genetic approach. With respect to beta diversity and ordination analyses, both approaches result in similar patterns. Water depth or related lake environmental conditions are significant factors influencing intra-lake diatom patterns, showing many significant negative correlations between alpha and beta diversity and water depth. Further, one near-shore and two lagoon lake sites characterized by low (0-10m) and medium (10-30m) water depth are unusual with unique taxonomic compositions. At deeper (>30m) water sites we identified strongest phylogenetic clustering in Aulacoseira, but generally much less in Staurosira, which supports that water depth is a strong environmental filter on the Aulacoseira communities. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining analyses of genetic and morphological as well as phylogenetic diversity to decipher compositional and generic phylogenetic patterns, which are relevant in understanding intra-lake heterogeneity as a source of biodiversity in the sub-arctic glacial Lake Bolshoe Toko.",2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0230284

Their use as bio-indicators is based on their morphological identification at species level using microscopy which is time consuming, requires taxonomic expertise, and is consequently expensive. To overcome these limitations, a molecular approach for diatom identification has been tested with success in rivers. DNA metabarcoding enables species identification from a standardized DNA barcode and high-throughput sequencing (HTS), using DNA reference library. The suitability of the morphological and molecular approaches to assess the diatom community structure and the ecological status of the littoral zone of the largest deep lake in France (Lake Bourget) was compared. 66 sites were sampled in August 2015 along the shoreline, all around the lake. The composition of diatom assemblages was similar with both morphological and molecular approaches, and diatom assemblages were structured by the same environmental factors. However, the ecological status of Lake Bourget differed significantly among approaches since floristic inventories to species level also differed significantly. The main source of this difference was the incompleteness of the DNA reference library. Nevertheless, in a near future, when this constraint will be solved, the use of DNA metabarcoding for biomonitoring purposes seems promising.",2018,10.1007/s10750-017-3381-2

However, conventional methods involving morphometric identification of macroinvertebrates are usually costly and time-consuming. Here we compare stream macroinvertebrate community metrics based on conventional morphometrics vs. non-destructive DNA metabarcoding from storage ethanol to assess forest management impacts on headwater streams across a gradient of intensively managed forest catchments in eastern Canada. The two approaches demonstrated substantial congruence in the detection of taxa (81% and 69% at the family and genus level, respectively) and in the characterization of community composition and richness. However, DNA metabarcoding from preservative ethanol identified significantly fewer genera (3.3 on average, 15.9%) and families (2.0, 11.5%) than conventional morphometrics. Taxa missed by metabarcoding of storage ethanol were typically those low in proportional mass or poorly represented in the CO1 reference database. This led to some differences in the explanatory variables identified as being related to macroinvertebrate metrics, which could have implications on conclusions and management actions that might result therefrom. For example, the negative relationships between richness and reach-scale variables associated with forest management intensity were weaker when richness was based on metabarcoding as compared to conventional morphometrics. Discriminatory power was greater when data at the genus level were used. The congruence between functional feeding group results derived from morphometric (based on relative abundance) vs. metabarcoding (based on relative frequency and read abundance) identifications was group specific (r = 0.16-0.63), but low overall. We conclude that DNA metabarcoding of storage ethanol provides a promising approach for characterizing stream macroinvertebrate communities, but that its full deployment in biomonitoring projects requires developing more complete reference libraries and enhancing the sensitivity for detecting taxa with low sample biomass.",2019,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.014

We here investigate how identification methods based on DNA (metabarcoding using NGS platforms) perform in comparison to morphological diatom identification and propose a workflow to optimize diatom fresh water quality assessments. Diatom diversity at seven different sites along the course of the river system Odra and Lusatian Neisse from the source to the mouth is analysed with DNA and morphological methods, which are compared. The NGS technology almost always leads to a higher number of identified taxa (270 via NGS vs. 103 by light microscopy LM), whose presence could subsequently be verified by LM. The sequence-based approach allows for a much more graduated insight into the taxonomic diversity of the environmental samples. Taxa retrieval varies considerably throughout the river system, depending on species occurrences and the taxonomic depth of the reference databases. Mostly rare taxa from oligotrophic parts of the river systems are less well represented in the reference database used. A workflow for DNA-based NGS diatom identification is presented. 28000 diatom sequences were evaluated.

As well as being an important area for local fisheries, the EEC is an ideal ecosystem for work on microbial diversity. This is because, although its environmental context is relatively complex, it is reasonably well understood due to several years of monitoring and morphological observations of its planktonic organisms. The objective of our study was to better understand the under-explored microbial eukaryotic diversity relative to the Phaeocystis bloom. Methodology and Principal Findings: The community structure of microplankton (diatoms, haptophytes, ciliates and dinoflagellates) was studied through morphological observations and tag pyrosequencing. During the annual Phaeocystis spring bloom, the phytoplankton biomass increased by 34-fold, while the microzooplankton biomass showed a 4-fold increase, representing on average about 4.6% of the biomass of their phytoplankton prey. Tag pyrosequencing unveiled an extensive diversity of Gymnodiniaceae, with G. spirale and G. fusiformis representing the most abundant reads. An extended diversity of Phaeocystales, with partial 18S rDNA genes sequence identity as low as 85% was found, with taxa corresponding to P. globosa, but also to unknown Phaeocystaceae. Conclusions: Morphological analyses and pyrosequencing were generally in accordance with capturing frequency shifts of abundant taxa. Tag pyrosequencing allowed highlighting the maintenance of microplankton diversity during the Phaeocystis bloom and the increase of the taxa presenting low number of reads (minor taxa) along with the dominant ones in response to biotic and/or abiotic changing conditions. Although molecular approaches have enhanced our perception on diversity, it has come to light that the challenge of modelling and predicting ecological change requires the use of different complementary approaches, to link taxonomic data with the functional roles of microbes in biogeochemical cycles.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0039924

In addition, metabarcoding of DNA extracted from environmental samples (eDNA) was concomitantly conducted in nine sampling sites in 2017 and in 2018 to compare the estimates of species richness and relative abundance among three methods: annual, long-term EF monitoring and eDNA. The present study confirms better detection of fish species using eDNA compared to annual EF. eDNA metabarcoding was also more efficient for species detection than a 3-6-year EF survey but was similar or less efficient than a long-term EF survey of 14 years of monitoring. In addition, the numbers of reads per species relative to the total number of reads significantly increased with (a) increasing relative abundance (relative percentage of individuals caught per species) and (b) increasing number of years that a fish species was detected during the 2000-2018 period.

Correct taxonomic identifications are critical to their use as bioindicators because closely related diatom species can respond differently to water physicochemical characteristics and pollutants. However, diatom identification based on morphology can be time consuming, and requires highly specialized taxonomic skills. To optimize diatom identification, DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used because it is generally less time consuming and may be more accurate than morphological identification. To date, however, neither DNA metabarcoding nor DNA barcoding diatom studies have been conducted in Mexico. Thus, we studied epilithic diatoms from streams in Central Mexico with a combination of morphological and metabarcoding techniques, and compared the diatoms identified and quantified by each method. We also assembled a barcode reference library based on clonal culturing. This library is composed of 190 strains that belong to 72 species in 24 genera. The morphological analysis of environmental samples resulted in the identification of 204 infrageneric taxa in 42 genera, but clonal culturing from the same samples retrieved 12 additional infrageneric taxa and 1 additional genus, thereby revealing concealed diversity. The metabarcoding approach resulted in the identification of 266 infrageneric taxa that belonged to 35 genera. Together, these methods detected 49 genera. Of these genera, 14 were identified only by morphology, 29 were identified by both methods, and 6 were only identified by metabarcoding. Of the 266 taxa we retrieved with metabarcoding, we confidently assigned 94 infrageneric taxa because a direct morphological or barcode sequence correlation was possible. Thirty-four of these 94 taxa were only detected with the metabarcoding method. One-fourth (23) of the assignments were only possible because of the barcode reference library we developed during this study, because there were no existing barcode sequences that matched these barcodes in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration databases. Large disparities existed between relative abundances based on valve counts and sequence reads of the most abundant taxa, even after we corrected for cell biovolume. Overall, we conclude that the combination of morphological and molecular methods increases the detection and identification of diatoms.",2019,10.1086/704827

Two key aquatic vertebrate groups were targeted: amphibians and bony fish. The reliability of this method was cautiously validated in silico, invitro and insitu.

For amphibians, the detection probability with eDNA metabarcoding was 0.97 (CI=0.90-0.99) vs. 0.58 (CI=0.50-0.63) for traditional surveys. For fish, in 89% of the studied sites, the number of taxa detected using the eDNA metabarcoding approach was higher or identical to the number detected using traditional methods.

However, the comparability and reliability of these studies is not well understood as we lack evidence on how different DNA extraction methods affect the detection of different organisms, and how this varies among sample types. Our aim was to quantify biases associated with six DNA extraction methods and identify one which is optimal for eDNA research targeting multiple organisms and sample types. We assessed each methods' ability to simultaneously extract bacterial, fungal, plant, animal and fish DNA from soil, leaf litter, stream water, stream sediment, stream biofilm and kick-net samples, as well as from mock communities. Method choice affected alpha-diversity for several combinations of taxon and sample type, with the majority of the differences occurring in the bacterial communities. While a single method performed optimally for the extraction of DNA from bacterial, fungal and plant mock communities, different methods performed best for invertebrate and fish mock communities. The consistency of methods, as measured by the similarity of community compositions resulting from replicate extractions, varied and was lowest for the animal communities. Collectively, these data provide the first comprehensive assessment of the biases associated with DNA extraction for both different sample types and taxa types, allowing us to identify DNeasy PowerSoil as a universal DNA extraction method. The adoption of standardized approaches for eDNA extraction will ensure that results can be more reliably compared, and biases quantified, thereby advancing eDNA as an ecological research tool.",2018,10.1111/1755-0998.12762

Environmentally sensitive diatoms respond to such ecological changes in terms of variation in diatom diversity and richness, which so far has only been documented by microscopic surveys. We applied next-generation sequencing to analyse the diatom composition of lake sediment DNA extracted from 32 lakes across the treeline in the Khatanga region, Siberia, using a short fragment of the rbcL chloroplast gene as a genetic barcode. We compared diatom richness and diversity obtained from the genetic approach with diatom counts from traditional microscopic analysis. Both datasets were employed to investigate diversity and relationships with environmental variables, using ordination methods. After effective filtering of the raw data, the two methods gave similar results for diatom richness and composition at the genus level (DNA 12 taxa; morphology 19 taxa), even though there was a much higher absolute number of sequences obtained per genetic sample (median 50,278), compared with microscopic counts (median 426). Dissolved organic carbon explained the highest percentage of variance in both datasets (14.2 % DNA; 18.7 % morphology), reflecting the compositional turnover of diatom assemblages along the tundra-taiga transition. Differences between the two approaches are mostly a consequence of the filtering process of genetic data and limitations of genetic references in the database, which restricted the determination of genetically identified sequence types to the genus level. The morphological approach, however, allowed identifications mostly to species level, which permits better ecological interpretation of the diatom data. Nevertheless, because of a rapidly increasing reference database, the genetic approach with sediment DNA will, in the future, enable reliable investigations of diatom composition from lake sediments that will have potential applications in both paleoecology and environmental monitoring.",2017,10.1007/s10933-016-9926-y

NICHOLS_2020_TOW,Towards routine DNA metabarcoding of macroinvertebrates using bulk samples for freshwater bioassessment: Effects of debris and storage conditions on the recovery of target taxa,"Nichols, Susan J.; Kefford, Ben J.; Campbell, Catriona D.; Bylemans, Jonas; Chandler, Eloise; Bray, Jonathan P.; Shackleton, Michael; Robinson, Katie L.; Carew, Melissa E.; Furlan, Elise M.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Macroinvertebrates are commonly sampled for bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems. However, current bioassessment protocols involve laborious sorting of the animals from the debris (sample matrix) and morphological identification, where species level identifications are often difficult. DNA metabarcoding has the potential to improve bioassessment by reducing the time taken to process samples and improve the accuracy and speed of macroinvertebrate species identification. In this study, we evaluated DNA metabarcoding of macroinvertebrate samples, which include macroinvertebrates and the debris collected in the sample nets, to test if bulk, unsorted samples can be used to assess macroinvertebrate diversity. First, we tested if the sample matrix prevented the detection of six target macroinvertebrate taxa when DNA metabarcoding. Second, we tested if sample storage influenced the detection of the same six target macroinvertebrates. We also explored different levels of replication at the sample, sub-sample, and polymerase chain reaction levels and compared the overall macroinvertebrate families detected using DNA metabarcoding to those identified morphologically. We found that the presence of the sample matrix did not interfere with or inhibit the detection of the six target macroinvertebrate taxa. Furthermore, we found that the various sample storage methods did not affect target macroinvertebrate detection. The reliability of detection of the target macroinvertebrates improved as hierarchical levels of replication were combined. We found strong overlap between the detection of overall macroinvertebrate family diversity when comparing DNA metabarcoding to morphological identification. Extracting DNA from the bulk macroinvertebrate samples that included the sample matrix and using this for DNA metabarcoding could improve bioassessment by removing the need for laborious sorting of samples. Furthermore, DNA metabarcoding detection of the six target taxa was not dependent on sample storage of up to 1 year in 95% ethanol, at room temperature or after heating. DNA metabarcoding had the advantage of identifying macroinvertebrate species, but good DNA barcode libraries are needed for widespread species identifications. Further investigation should focus on including multiple samples with different macroinvertebrate composition and densities to refine and standardise bulk sample processing protocols, and on building comprehensive DNA barcode libraries for aquatic macroinvertebrates.",2020,10.1111/fwb.13443

However, biodiversity measurements often remain incomplete due to the limited efficiency of sampling methods. This is particularly true in freshwater tropical environments that host rich fish assemblages, for which assessments are uncertain and often rely on destructive methods. Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and similar to 17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which similar to 8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.",2019,10.1111/1755-0998.12900

In order to evaluate the suitability of metabarcoding for zooplankton biodiversity assessment and biomonitoring as a fast and more cost-effective method, seasonal zooplankton sampling was carried out in the Venice Lagoon and the nearby coastal area (Northern Adriatic Sea). The molecular analysis showed higher taxa richness compared to the classical morphological method (224 vs. 88 taxa), discriminating better the meroplanktonic component, morphologically identified only up to order level. Both methods revealed a similar spatio-temporal distribution pattern and the sequence abundances and individual counts were significantly correlated for various taxonomic groups. These results indicate that DNA metabarcoding is an efficient tool for biodiversity assessments in ecosystems with high spatial and temporal variability, where high sampling effort is required as well as fast alert systems for non-native species (NIS).",2020,10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.104946

However, an accurate cyst identification proves to be a more difficult and extremely challenging process, even today. In order to gain a better taxonomic coverage of cyst assemblages in the Black Sea, an integrated approach of the classical morphological identification with metabarcoding methods (MySeq sequencing of V7-V9 regions of the 18S rDNA) was applied on thirteen surface sediment samples collected from different sites. A total number of 112 dinoflagellate taxa was detected at the species level and ascribed to 51 genera. In general, it is the molecular analysis that yields a higher number of taxa as compared to those obtained through the morphological taxonomy (66 taxa based on the DNA sequences versus 56 morphologically-identified taxa). Besides, it should be pointed out that the integrated dataset includes 14 potentially toxic dinoflagellate species. Discerned, subsequently, was a good dataset consistency for ten species, followed by some discrepancies as to a number of taxa, identified with one of the methods only, due to specific methodological biases.

A comparative study with microscopy,"Abad, David; Albaina, Aitor; Aguirre, Mikel; Laza-Martinez, Aitor; Uriarte, Ibon; Iriarte, Arantza; Villate, Fernando; Estonba, Andone",MARINE BIOLOGY,"Metabarcoding is becoming an increasingly valuable alternative approach to biodiversity assessment, due to the combination of extreme sensitivity and potential for the highest taxonomic resolution in a cost-and time-effective methodology. To evaluate the capacity of metabarcoding for estuarine plankton monitoring, a comparison between the results obtained with this approach were compared with those based on traditional taxonomic analysis (microscopy). Database incompleteness, one of the main limitations of metabarcoding, was somewhat overcome by the addition of DNA sequences for local species, which increased the taxonomic assignment success from 23.7 to 50.5 %. When the communities were studied along with environmental variables, similar spatial and temporal trends of taxonomic diversity were observed for metabar-coding and microscopic studies of zooplankton, but not for phytoplankton. This is most likely attributable to the lack of representative sequences for phytoplankton species in current databases. In addition, there was high correspondence in community composition when comparing abundances estimated from metabarcoding and microscopy, suggesting semiquantitative potential for metabarcoding. Furthermore, metabarcoding allowed the detection and identification of two non-indigenous species (NIS) found in the study area at abundances hardly detectable by microscopy. Overall, our results indicate that metabarcoding is a powerful approach with excellent possibilities for use in plankton monitoring, early detection of NIS and plankton biodiversity shifts.",2016,10.1007/s00227-016-2920-0
HUO_2020_COM,Combining morphological and metabarcoding approaches reveals the freshwater eukaryotic phytoplankton community,"Huo, Shouliang; Li, Xiaochuang; Xi, Beidou; Zhang, Hanxiao; Ma, Chunzi; He, Zhuoshi",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background Phytoplankton diversity can be difficult to ascertain from morphological analyses, because of the existence of cryptic species and pico- and concealed phytoplankton. In-depth sequencing and metabarcoding can reveal microbial diversity, and identify novel diversity. However, there has been little comparison of metabarcoding and morphological datasets derived from the same samples, and metabarcoding studies covering total eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity are rare. In this study, the variable V7 region of the 18S rDNA gene was employed to explore eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity in 11 Chinese freshwater environments, and further compared with the dataset obtained through morphological identification. Results Annotation by the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) rather than alignment with the SILVA database improved the taxonomic resolution, with 346 of 524 phytoplankton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being assigned to the genus or species level. The number of unassigned OTUs was greatly reduced from 259 to 178 OTUs by using the EPA in place of the SILVA database. Metabarcoding detected 3.5 times more OTUs than the number of morphospecies revealed by morphological identification; furthermore, the number of species and the Shannon-Wiener index inferred from the two methods were correlated. A total of 34 genera were identified via both methods, while 31 and 123 genera were detected solely in the morphological or metabarcoding dataset, respectively. Conclusion The dbRDA plot showed distinct separation of the phytoplankton communities between lakes and reservoirs according to the metabarcoding dataset. The same pattern was obtained on the basis of 10 environmental variables in the PCO ordination plot, while the separation of the populations based on morphological data was poor. However, 30 morphospecies contributed 70% of the community difference between lakes and reservoirs in the morphological dataset, while 11 morphospecies were not found by metabarcoding. Considering the limitations of each of the two methods, their combination could substantially improve phytoplankton community assessment.",2020,10.1186/s12302-020-00321-w
MOHRBECK_2015_HIG,High-Throughput Sequencing-The Key to Rapid Biodiversity Assessment of Marine Metazoa?,"Mohrbeck, Inga; Raupach, Michael J.; Arbizu, Pedro Martinez; Knebelsberger, Thomas; Laakmann, Silke",PLOS ONE,"The applications of traditional morphological and molecular methods for species identification are greatly restricted by processing speed and on a regional or greater scale are generally considered unfeasible. In this context, high-throughput sequencing, or metagenetics, has been proposed as an efficient tool to document biodiversity. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of 454 pyrosequencing in marine metazoan community analysis using the 18S rDNA: V1-V2 region. Multiplex pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region was used to analyze two pooled samples of DNA, one comprising 118 and the other 37 morphologically identified species, and one natural sample taken directly from a North Sea zooplankton community. A DNA reference library comprising all species represented in the pooled samples was created by Sanger sequencing, and this was then used to determine the optimal similarity threshold for species delineation. The optimal threshold was found at 99% species similarity, with 85% identification success. Pyrosequencing was able to identify between fewer species: 67% and 78% of the species in the two pooled samples. Also, a large number of sequences for three species that were not included in the pooled samples were amplified by pyrosequencing, suggesting preferential amplification of some genotypes and the sensitivity of this approach to even low levels of contamination. Conversely, metagenetic analysis of the natural zooplankton sample identified many more species (particularly gelatinous zooplankton and meroplankton) than morphological analysis of a formalin-fixed sample from the same sampling site, suggesting an increased level of taxonomic resolution with pyrosequencing. The study demonstrated that, based on the V1-V2 region, 454 sequencing does not provide accurate species differentiation and reliable taxonomic classification, as it is required in most biodiversity monitoring. The analysis of artificially prepared samples indicated that species detection in pyrosequencing datasets is complicated by potential PCR-based biases and that the V1-V2 marker is poorly resolved for some taxa.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140342

To this end, we collected zooplankton samples from the subarctic coastal waters off Japan using two plankton nets: 1) Kitahara Quantitative Plankton Net (Kitahara net) with a 0.04-m(2) opening and 100-mu m mesh and 2) North Pacific Standard Plankton Net (Norpac net) with 0.16-m(2) opening and 335-mu m mesh. We then conducted 18S rDNA metagenetic and morphological analyses of the resulting catches. Molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) at 97% similarity revealed higher diversity than did the morphological analysis, especially for morphologically unidentified taxa (e.g., Gastropoda and Polychaeta larvae), suggesting the effectiveness of the metagenetic method for characterizing zooplankton communities. Samples obtained with the Kitahara net produced more sequence reads of non-metazoan taxa, mainly derived from phytoplankton, leading to smaller numbers of available sequence reads for metazoan plankton. Numbers of morphological taxa were higher in the Norpac net samples. However, we expected metagenetic analysis to reveal higher diversity for the Kitahara net, due to larger MOTU numbers from smaller-sized taxa. Small-sized taxa also accounted for a larger proportion of sequence reads in the Kitahara net samples. In contrast, the diversity of large-sized taxa was better represented in the Norpac net sample. Although these differences were expected from the morphological analysis, effects of plankton net characteristics were more clearly reflected by metagenetic analysis than the morphological analysis.

This study compares zooplankton taxonomic composition revealed through metabarcoding of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 18S rRNA genes to traditional morphological identification by microscopy. Triplicates of three different sample types were collected from three coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary: (1) 1 L surface seawater samples prefiltered through 3 mu m filters and subsequently collected on 0.22 mu m filters for eDNA (PF-eDNA); (2) 1 L surface seawater samples filtered on 0.22 mu m pore-size filters (environmental DNA; eDNA), and (3) zooplankton tissue samples from 64 mu m, 200 m, and 500 m mesh size net tows. The zooplankton tissue samples were split, with half identified morphologically and tissue DNA (T-DNA) extracted from the other half. The COI and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding of PF-eDNA, eDNA, and T-DNA samples was performed using Illumina MiSeq. Of the families detected with COI and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding, 40% and 32%, respectively, were also identified through morphological assessments. Significant differences in taxonomic composition were observed between PF-DNA, eDNA, and T-DNA with both genetic markers. PF-eDNA resulted in detection of fewer taxa than the other two sample types; thus, prefiltering is not recommended. All dominant copepod taxa (> 5% of total abundance) were detected with eDNA, T-DNA, and morphological assessments, demonstrating that eDNA metabarcoding is a promising technique for future biodiversity assessments of pelagic zooplankton in marine systems.",2018,10.1002/lom3.10237

Bivalve larvae revealed different patterns, and at least five bivalve taxa were only detected by the NGS. According to the NGS results, most bivalve larvae were Crassostrea gigas (37%), followed by Ruditapes philippinarum (26%), and Solen strictus (23%); Mactra chinensis and M. veneriformis accounted for< 1% of the bivalve larvae. C. gigas and S. strictus were most abundant in late June, but rare in the other investigated periods, while R. philippinarum was more abundant in June and late September.

Following the advances in molecular methods, phytoplankton studies are switching from using classical microscopy to high throughput sequencing approaches. However, methodological comparisons of these approaches have rarely been reported. In this study, we compared the two methods, using a unique dataset of multiple water samples taken from a natural freshwater environment. Environmental DNA was extracted from 300 water samples collected weekly during 20 years, followed by high throughput sequencing of amplicons from the 16S and 18S rRNA hypervariable regions. For each water sample, phytoplankton diversity was also estimated using light microscopy. Our study indicates that species compositions detected by light microscopy and 454 high throughput sequencing do not always match. High throughput sequencing detected more rare species and picoplankton than light microscopy, and thus gave a better assessment of phytoplankton diversity. However, when compared to light microscopy, high throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons did not adequately identify phytoplankton at the species level. In summary, our study recommends a combined strategy using both morphological and molecular techniques.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0106510
NICHOLS_2019_RAP,Rapid assessment of coral cover from environmental DNA in Hawai'i,"Nichols, Patrick K.; Marko, Peter B.",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Coral reefs support the most diverse assemblages of marine life on Earth, yet are declining due to local and global stressors. Rapid and widespread monitoring is essential for tracking ecosystem responses, but assessment of coral communities traditionally relies on time-consuming visual estimates of coral cover, the percentage of substrate occupied by living corals. The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers fast and efficient insights into the abundance and distribution of species, yet it remains untested to monitor coral biomass. Here, we demonstrate that visual estimates are highly correlated with the abundance of coral eDNA on reefs in Hawai'i measured with a relatively simple, rapid, but replicated PCR-based metabarcoding approach. Target sequence length was also tested by amplifying short ( 120 base-pairs) and long ( 400 base-pairs) fragments from the same region of two mitochondrial DNA genes, 16S ribosomal DNA, and cytochrome oxidase-1 using primers designed to preferentially amplify Hawaiian coral genera. Careful primer selection and target sequence lengths play an important role in determination of coral abundance from eDNA biomass. Given its broad applicability and ease of use, eDNA metabarcoding can provide complementary analytical support for biomonitoring programs and management initiatives tracking changes in coral cover caused by climate change and other disturbances on coral reefs.",2019,10.1002/edn3.8

Samples were collected in August 2013 at the Outer Oslofjorden, Norway. Total RNA/cDNA was amplified by haptophyte-specific primers targeting the V4 region of the 18S, and the D1-D2 region of the 28S rRNA.

E.; Rees, Gavin N.; Watson, G.; Campbell, C.; Nielsen, D.",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Globally, floodplain wetlands have been dramatically impacted by changes in water regimes. A key indicator of change in wetland state is riparian and aquatic plant community composition. Plant communities are traditionally assessed by visual monitoring programs that assess community composition. However, results from these monitoring programs may be effected by antecedent conditions that govern plant growth, such as season. In this study we used environmental DNA (eDNA) to assess the spatial composition of wetland vegetation communities from six floodplain complexes along the Murray River, Australia and compared results to those derived from tradition plant surveys. Our analyses of eDNA were conducted targeting two gene regions: 18S RNA and trnL at the species and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels. Analysis revealed significant similarity between the spatial patterns derived from the eDNA data and those derived from the traditional monitoring data. Moreover, using the eDNA data, analysis of endemicity revealed the majority of OTUs and species occurred only at a single wetland or wetland complex. Few genera were shared between the traditional survey data set and the molecular data sets. But for those that were shared, detectability varied between gene fragments and among genera, ranging from 11 to 100% in the trnL data to 14.3-100% in the 18S data. Our results show that landscape patterns in plant communities can be reliably derived from eDNA analysis, thus providing a cost-effective way of undertaking vegetation surveys. (C) 2019 The Authors.

We assessed fish communities in a stream using two methods, depletion-based electrofishing and environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) from water samples, to test the hypothesis that eDNA provides an alternative means of determining species richness and species identities for a natural ecosystem. In a northern Indiana stream, electrofishing yielded a direct estimate of 12 species and a mean estimated richness (Chao II estimator) of 16.6 species with a 95% confidence interval from 12.8 to 42.2. eDNA sampling detected an additional four species, congruent with the mean Chao II estimate from electrofishing. This increased detection rate for fish species between methods suggests that eDNA sampling can enhance estimation of fish fauna in flowing waters while having minimal sampling impacts on fish and their habitat. Modern genetic approaches therefore have the potential to transform our ability to build a more complete list of species for ecological investigations and inform management of aquatic ecosystems.",2016,10.1002/ece3.2186
HARVEY_2017_COM,Comparison of morphological and next generation DNA sequencing methods for assessing zooplankton assemblages,"Harvey, Julio B. J.; Johnson, Shannon B.; Fisher, Jennifer L.; Peterson, William T.; Vrijenhoek, Robert C.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Morphological taxonomic methods are currently insufficient to satisfy the rising demand for taxonomic information and rapid sample turnover required to support conservation and resource management efforts. Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) is capable of rapidly producing taxonomic assessments for a broad diversity of organisms present in environmental samples. To achieve taxonomic coverage of similar breadth, multiple morphologists who tend to specialize by taxonomic group would be required. Unfortunately, both morphological and molecular approaches are subject to various methodological biases. Accurate assessment (both taxonomic composition and abundances) of marine zooplankton assemblages is a critical component of effective ecosystem-based conservation and resource management efforts. To address this need and determine the extent of agreement between methods, morphological data was compared to 454 NGS results for zooplankton assemblages collected in plankton net tows from northern Monterey Bay, California. Results indicate areas of agreement between data sets, but also characterize biases specific to each method. Morphological analyses provided life history stage and biomass information for many zooplankton taxa. The NGS data included 313 bp from the 3' end of the mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit-I (COI; 3234 OTUs) region and 365 bp from the 5' end of the large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (28S; 1669 OTUs). Results of NGS analysis corroborated the presence of 40 of the 61 morphologically identified genera and species. For some organisms, NGS provided finer taxonomic resolution where morphological data or knowledge was limited. Correlations between biomass and NGS percent sequence abundances were significant for some, but not all taxa, and were gene-specific in some cases (i.e., COI-Diplostraca, Polychaeta, Callianassidae, Clausocalanidae, Oncaeidae, Podonidae, Evadne, Neottypaea, Oncaea, Podon, Psuedocalanus; 28S-Euphausiacea, Euphausiidae, Oncaeidae, Oncaea). Despite various methodological biases, both data sets were in agreement with respect to alpha diversity indices generated for zooplankton assemblages collected at four sampling stations. These results suggest that a partnership between morphological and molecular methods represents a powerful tool, that when used appropriately, can effectively extend taxonomic assessment capabilities to better address present needs.

For this, we compared the values of a biotic index (IPS) and the ecological status classes derived from them, between light microscope-based (LM) and HTS methods. Very good correspondence between methods gives encouraging results concerning the applicability of DNA metabarcoding for Catalan rivers for the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, in 10 sites, the ecological status class was downgraded from “Good”/”High” obtained by LM to “Moderate”/”Poor”/”Bad” by HTS; these “critical” sites are especially important, because theWFD requires remedial action by water managers for any river withModerate or lower status. We investigated the contribution of each species to the IPS using a “leave-one-out” sensitivity analysis, paying special attention to critical sites. Discrepancies in IPS between LM and HTS were mainly due to the misidentification and overlooking in LM of a few species, which were better recovered by HTS. This bias was particularly important in the case of Fistulifera saprophila, whose clear underrepresentation in LM was important for explaining 8 out of the 10 critical sites and probably reflected destruction of weakly-silicified frustules during sample preparation. Differences between species in the rbcL copy number per cell affected the relative abundance obtained by HTS for Achnanthidium minutissimum, Nitzschia inconspicua and Ulnaria ulna, which were also identified by the sensitivity analysis as important for the WFD. Only minor IPS discrepancies were attributed to the incompleteness of the reference library, as most of the abundant and influential species (to the IPS) were well represented there. Finally, we propose that leave-one-out analysis is a good method for identifying priority species for isolation and barcoding. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the influence of environmental change on zooplankton communities under field-conditions is hindered by traditional labor-intensive approaches that are prone to taxonomic and enumeration mistakes. Here, metabarcoding of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) region of mitochondrial DNA was used to characterize the genetic diversity of zooplankton. The species composition of zooplankton communities determined by metabarcoding was consistent with the results based on the traditional morphological approach. The spatial distribution of common species (frequency of occurrence > 10 samples) by metabarcoding exhibited good agreement with morphological data. Furthermore, metabarcoding can clearly distinguish the composition of the zooplankton community between lake and river ecosystems. In general, rotifers were more abundant in riverine environments than lakes and reservoirs. Finally, the sequence read number of different taxonomic groups using metabarcoding was positively correlated with the zooplankton biomass inferred by density and body length of zooplankton.

Here, we directly compare morphological and Illumina data obtained from the same samples, in an effort to characterize ciliate faunas from sediments in freshwater environments. We show how in silico processing affects the final outcome of our HTS analysis, providing evidence that quality filtering protocols strongly impact the number of predicted taxa, but not downstream conclusions such as biogeography patterns. We determine the abundance distribution of ciliates, showing that a small fraction of abundant taxa dominates read counts. At the same time, we advance reasons to believe that biases affecting HTS abundances may be significant enough to blur part of the underlying biological picture. We confirmed that the HTS approach detects many more taxa than morphological inspections, and highlight how the difference varies among taxonomic groups. Finally, we hypothesize that the two datasets actually correspond to different conceptions of diversity, and consequently that neither is entirely superior to the other when investigating environmental protists.",2017,10.1007/s00248-016-0912-8

This step is frequently a bottleneck in the analytical chain from sampling to data analysis and subsequent environmental status evaluation. Here we present phytoplankton diversity data from 49 lakes including three seasonal surveys assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal RNA chloroplast and cyanobacterial gene amplicons and also compare part of these datasets with identification based on morphology. Direct comparison of NGS to microscopic data from three time-series showed that NGS was able to capture the seasonality in phytoplankton succession as observed by microscopy. Still, the PCR-based approach was only semi-quantitative, and detailed NGS and microscopy taxa lists had only low taxonomic correspondence. This is probably due to, both, methodological constraints and current discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks. Discrepancies included Euglenophyta and Heterokonta that were scarce in the NGS but frequently detected by microscopy and Cyanobacteria that were in general more abundant and classified with high resolution by NGS. A deep-branching taxonomically unclassified cluster was frequently detected by NGS but could not be linked to any group identified by microscopy. NGS derived phytoplankton composition differed significantly among lakes with different trophic status, showing that our approach can resolve phytoplankton communities at a level relevant for ecosystem management. The high reproducibility and potential for standardization and parallelization makes our NGS approach an excellent candidate for simultaneous monitoring of prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton in inland waters.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0053516
LEESE_2021_IMP,Improved freshwater macroinvertebrate detection from environmental DNA through minimized nontarget amplification,"Leese, Florian; Sander, Mandy; Buchner, Dominik; Elbrecht, Vasco; Haase, Peter; Zizka, Vera M. A.",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"DNA metabarcoding of freshwater communities typically relies on PCR amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene with degenerate primers. The advantage of COI is its taxonomic resolution and the availability of an extensive reference database. However, when universal primers are used on environmental DNA (eDNA) isolated from water, benthic invertebrate read and OTU numbers are typically “watered down,” that is, under represented, compared to whole specimen “bulk samples” due to greater co-amplification of abundant nontarget taxa (e.g., fungi, algae, and bacteria). Because benthic stream invertebrate taxa are of prime importance for regulatory biomonitoring, more effective ways to capture their diversity via eDNA isolated from water are important. In this study, we aimed to improve benthic invertebrate assessment from eDNA by minimizing nontarget amplification. Therefore, we generated eDNA data using universal primers BF2/BR2 on samples collected throughout 15 months from a German Long-Term Ecological Research site (Rhine-Main-Observatory, Kinzig River) to identify most abundant nontarget taxa. Based on these data, we designed a new reverse primer (EPTDr2n) with 3’-specificity toward benthic invertebrate taxa and validated its specificity in silico together with universal forward primer fwhF2 using available data from GenBank and BOLD. We then performed in situ tests using 20 Kinzig River eDNA samples. We found that the percentage of target reads was much higher for the new primer combination compared to two universal benthic invertebrate primer pairs, BF2/BR2 and fwhF2/fwhR2n (99.6% versus 25.89% and 39.04%, respectively). Likewise, the number of detected benthic invertebrate species was substantially higher (305 versus 113 and 185) and exceeded the number of 153 species identified by expert taxonomists at nearby sites across two decades of sampling. While few taxa, such as flatworms, were not detected, we show that the optimized primer avoids the nontarget amplification bias and thus significantly improves benthic invertebrate detection from eDNA.",2021,10.1002/edn3.177
LIU_2017_THE,The diversity and structure of marine protists in the coastal waters of China revealed by morphological observation and 454 pyrosequencing,"Liu, Yun; Song, Shuqun; Chen, Tiantian; Li, Caiwen",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"Pyrosequencing of the 18S rRNA gene has been widely adopted to study the eukaryotic diversity in various types of environments, and has an advantage over traditional morphology methods in exploring unknown microbial communities. To comprehensively assess the diversity and community composition of marine protists in the coastal waters of China, we applied both morphological observations and high throughput sequencing of the V2 and V3 regions of 18S rDNA simultaneously to analyze samples collected from the surface layer of the Yellow and East China Seas. Dinoflagellates, diatoms and ciliates were the three dominant protistan groups as revealed by the two methods. Diatoms were the first dominant protistan group in the microscopic observations, with Skeletonema mainly distributed in the nearshore eutrophic waters and Chaetoceros in higher temperature and higher pH waters. The mixotrophic dinoflagellates, Gymnodinium and Gyrodinium, were more competitive in the oligotrophic waters. The pyrosequencing method revealed an extensive diversity of dinoflagellates. Chaetoceros was the only dominant diatom group in the pyrosequencing dataset. Gyrodinium represented the most abundant reads and dominated the offshore oligotrophic protistan community as they were in the microscopic observations. The dominance of parasitic dinoflagellates in the pyrosequencing dataset, which were overlooked in the morphological observations, indicates more attention should be paid to explore the potential role of this group. Both methods provide coherent clustering of samples. Nutrient levels, salinity and pH were the main factors influencing the distribution of protists. This study demonstrates that different primer pairs used in the pyrosequencing will indicate different protistan community structures. A suitable marker may reveal more comprehensive composition of protists and provide valuable information on environmental drivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, investigation of zooplankton communities in marine and coastal national parks is essential. However, the surveys of zooplankton communities using morphological identification require considerable time and labor. Metabarcoding is a practical alternative that can detect various taxa simultaneously. In this study, metabarcoding was newly applied along with the traditional morphological identification to establish a method for zooplankton community survey in the Marine and Coastal National Park areas of Korea. By comparing the results of these two identification methods, the strengths and limitations of metabarcoding were verified with the zooplankton communities appearing in these areas. The sensitive detection capability of metabarcoding enabled the identification of potential bioindicator taxa associated with external factors (e.g., water temperature, salinity, topography, and chlorophyllaconcentration) in these national parks. We propose the use of metabarcoding for efficient surveys of mesozooplankton communities in the Marine and Coastal National Parks to establish monitoring of bioindicator taxa. It is also necessary to continuously search for taxa with high research value in these national parks using metabarcoding. Establishing an ongoing monitoring system that employs this approach can provide an effective tool for managing marine ecosystems in the Marine and Coastal National Parks.",2020,10.3390/d12060233
LI_2019_MET,Metabarcoding reveals a more complex cyanobacterial community than morphological identification,"Li, XiaoChuang; Huo, Shouliang; Zhang, Jingtian; Ma, Chunzi; Xiao, Zhe; Zhang, Hanxiao; Xi, Beidou; Xia, Xinghui",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Next generation sequencing has become a popular method to identify cyanobacterial diversity in ecosystems. Morphological identification poses challenges in deciphering cyanobacterial diversity because phenotypic variations can be misleading, picocyanobacteria are ignored easily, specialists familiar with classification systems are lacking, and updates of taxonomic treatises are not shared in a timely manner or adopted by researchers engaged in monitoring of phytoplankton. In this study, metabarcoding of 54 samples from 7 freshwater systems yielded saturated cyanobacterial sequences, and the compositions of the resulting communities were compared with a dataset generated by morphological identification. A total of 69 cyanobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were finally codetermined through the ribosomal database project (RDP) via the Silva database and blast analysis using a database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Blast resolved more OTUs, with 1 and 27 OTUs identified at the species level and 35 and 9 OTUs identified at the genus levels through Silva and NCBI, respectively. Only 13 OTUs were matched at genus levels by these two methods. The accuracy of blast was further verified through molecular phylogeny. Blast results were compared with morphological identification at the genus level. Each method identified 26 genera, and 12 genera were shared by both methods. Half of the genera only identified by metabarcoding have been described recently, and data on morphologically diagnostic characters were not available. Some genera shared morphological similarities, which led them to be misidentified. Ten of the 12 genera found by both methods yielded less than 2 morphological mismatches. These genera produced a higher proportion of occurrences in metabarcoding, which was indicative of higher sensitivity to cyanobacteria. A larger number of species were found in metabarcoding (8-38 OTUs) than in morphological surveys (1-16 morphospecies), nevertheless, the results were positively correlated (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). Metabarcoding yielded data that produced a clearer separation of cyanobacterial communities from different systems and seasons as seen in non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) ordinations. In conclusion, metabarcoding could provide a more accurate picture of cyanobacterial communities.",2019,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105653

However, it is difficult to identify cryptic species and immature stages of zooplankton using morphological classification, which is time-consuming and requires high skill levels. Here, we conducted a metagenetic analysis of the 18S region in 101 zooplankton samples collected weekly throughout 2014 and 2015 at the Okhotsk Tower in Mombetsu, Hokkaido, Japan, and compared the results of this analysis with those provided by morphological analysis. The metagenetic analysis detected 561 molecular taxonomic units (MOTUs), whereas the morphological analysis detected 201 taxonomic groups. Zooplankton communities were dominated by copepods throughout the sampling period; however, non-copepod taxa, which comprised high proportions of both MOTUs (mean 51.1%) and sequence reads (mean 19.1%), were also important. Cryptic diversity detected by the metagenetic analysis was primarily driven by Copepoda and by the larvae of benthic taxa such as Bivalvia, Gastropoda, and Polychaeta. Community structure and diversity varied between periods of warm and cold water, indicating strong correlations with water temperature and thus seasonality. Furthermore, metagenetic analysis revealed detailed seasonal changes in dominant taxa, including larval stages of metazoans with high taxonomic resolutions; these included commercially important organisms such as Japanese scallops. The metagenetic analysis revealed that changes in both water mass and bentho-pelagic interactions sustain ecosystems rich in zooplankton diversity in this area. Metagenetic analysis provides novel insight into zooplankton diversity, and generates massive sequence data that may be used in future research; thus, it is considered an effective tool for monitoring zooplankton communities.",2017,10.3389/fmars.2017.00379

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has provided a promising tool to enable fast and comprehensive monitoring of entire ecosystems, but widespread adoption of this technique requires performance evaluations that compare it with conventional surveys. We compared eDNA metabarcoding and trawling data to evaluate their efficiency to characterize demersal fish communities in the Estuary and Gulf of Saint-Lawrence, Canada. Seawater and bottom trawling samples were collected in parallel at 84 stations. For a subset of 30 of these stations, water was also collected at three different depths (15, 50, and 250 m) across the water column. An eDNA metabarcoding assay based on the 12S mitochondrial gene using the MiFish-U primers was applied to detect fish eDNA. We detected a total of 88 fish species with both methods combined, with 72 species being detected by eDNA, 64 species detected by trawl, and 47 species (53%) overlapped between both methods. eDNA was more efficient for quantifying species richness, mainly because it detected species known to be less vulnerable to trawling gear. Our results indicated that the relative abundance estimated by eDNA and trawl is significantly correlated for species detected by both methods, while the relationship was also influenced by environmental variables (temperature, depth, salinity, and oxygen). Integrating eDNA metabarcoding to bottom trawling surveys could provide additional information on vertical fish distribution in the water column. Environmental DNA metabarcoding thus appears to be a reliable and complementary approach to trawling surveys for documenting fish biodiversity, including for obtaining relative quantitative estimates in the marine environment.",2021,10.1002/edn3.111

This study examined the extent to which species richness can be estimated in a small coral reef lagoon (1,500 × 900 m) near Okinawa Island, southern Japan, where the surrounding waters are likely to harbor more than 1,500 species of fish. During 2015–2017, a total of 16 capture-based surveys were conducted to create a faunal list of fish species, followed by eDNA metabarcoding based on seawater samples taken from 11 sites in the lagoon on a day in May 2019. We also tested whether eDNA metabarcoding could detect differences between adjacent fish communities inhabiting the offshore reef edge and shore-side seagrass beds within the lagoon. A total of 217 fish species were confirmed by the capture-based samplings, while 291 fish species were detected by eDNA metabarcoding, identifying a total of 410 species distributed across 119 families and 193 genera. Of these 410 species, only 96 (24% of the total) were commonly identified by both methods, indicating that capture-based surveys failed to collect a number of species detected by eDNA metabarcoding. Interestingly, two different approaches to estimate species richness based on eDNA data yielded values close to the 410 species, including one that suggested an additional three or more eDNA surveys from 11 sites (36 samples) would detect 90% of the 410 species. In addition, nonmetric multidimensional scaling for fish assemblages clearly distinguished between the fish communities of the offshore reef edge and those of the shore-side seagrass beds. This study demonstrates that an eDNA metabarcoding approach is useful for estimating species richness and detection of habitat segregation even in ecosystems with remarkably high species diversity.",2021,10.1002/edn3.132
BOIVIN‐DELISLE_2021_USI,Using environmental DNA for biomonitoring of freshwater fish communities: Comparison with established gillnet surveys in a boreal hydroelectric impoundment,"Boivin‐Delisle, Damien; Laporte, Martin; Burton, Frédéric; Dion, René; Normandeau, Eric; Bernatchez, Louis",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Accurate data characterizing species distribution and abundance are critical for conservation and management of aquatic resources. Inventory methods, such as gillnet surveys, are widely used to estimate distribution and abundance of fish. However, gillnet surveys can be costly in terms of material and human resources, may cause unwanted mortality in the fish communities being studied, and is subject to size and species selection bias. Detecting allochthonous DNA released by species in their environment (i.e., environmental DNA, hereafter eDNA) could be used as a noninvasive and less costly alternative. In this study, we directly compare eDNA metabarcoding and gillnets for monitoring freshwater fish communities in terms of species richness and relative species abundance. Metabarcoding was performed with the 12S Mifish primers. We also used species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the most abundant species, the walleye (Sander vitreus), to compare estimated relative abundance with metabarcoding and gillnet captures. Water sample collection, prior to gillnet assessment, was performed on 17 sites in the hydroelectric impoundment of the Rupert River (James Bay, Canada), comparing two water filtration methods. After controlling for amplification biases and repeatability, we show that fish communities’ complexity is better represented using eDNA metabarcoding than previously recorded gillnet data and that metabarcoding read count correlates with qPCR (r = 0.78, p < .001) in reflecting walleye abundance. Finally, based on partial redundancy analysis, we identified alpha chlorophyll, pH, and dissolved oxygen as environmental variable candidates that may influence differences in fish relative abundance between metabarcoding and gillnets. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the proposed eDNA metabarcoding method can be used as an efficient alternative or complementary technique adapted to the biomonitoring of the fish communities in boreal aquatic ecosystems.",2021,10.1002/edn3.135

Examining the capacity of eDNA to provide accurate biodiversity measures in species-rich ecosystems such as coral reefs is a prerequisite for their application in long-term monitoring. Here, we surveyed two Colombian tropical marine reefs, the island of Providencia and Gayraca Bay near Santa Marta, using eDNA and underwater visual census (UVC) methods. We collected a large quantity of surface water (30 L per filter) above the reefs and applied a metabarcoding protocol using three different primer sets targeting the 12S mitochondrial DNA, which are specific to the vertebrates Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii. By assigning eDNA sequences to species using a public reference database, we detected the presence of 107 and 85 fish species, 106 and 92 genera, and 73 and 57 families in Providencia and Gayraca Bay, respectively. Of the species identified using eDNA, 32.7% (Providencia) and 18.8% (Gayraca) were also found in the UVCs. We further found congruence in genus and species richness and abundance between eDNA and UVC approaches in Providencia but not in Gayraca Bay. Mismatches between eDNA and UVC had a phylogenetic and ecological signal, with eDNA detecting a broader phylogenetic diversity and more effectively detecting smaller species, pelagic species and those in deeper habitats. Altogether, eDNA can be used for fast and broad biodiversity surveys and is applicable to species-rich ecosystems in the tropics, but improved coverage of the reference database is required before this new method could serve as an effective complement to traditional census methods.",2021,10.1002/edn3.140

Metabarcoding markers need sufficient taxonomic coverage to detect groups of interest, sufficient sequence divergence to resolve species, and will ideally indicate relative abundance of taxa present. We characterized zooplankton assemblages with three different metabarcoding markers (nuclear 18S rDNA, mitochondrial COI, and mitochondrial 16S rDNA) to compare their performance in terms of taxonomic coverage, taxonomic resolution, and correspondence between morphology-and DNA-based identification. COI amplicons sequenced on separate runs showed that operational taxonomic units representing >0.1% of reads per sample were highly reproducible, although slightly more taxa were detected using a lower annealing temperature. Mitochondrial COI and nuclear 18S showed similar taxonomic coverage across zooplankton phyla. However, mitochondrial COI resolved up to threefold more taxa to species compared to 18S. All markers revealed similar patterns of beta-diversity, although different taxa were identified as the greatest contributors to these patterns for 18S. For calanoid copepod families, all markers displayed a positive relationship between biomass and sequence reads, although the relationship was typically strongest for 18S. The use of COI for metabarcoding has been questioned due to lack of conserved primer-binding sites. However, our results show the taxonomic coverage and resolution provided by degenerate COI primers, combined with a comparatively well-developed reference sequence database, make them valuable metabarcoding markers for biodiversity assessment.",2017,10.1002/ece3.2667

We performed a pilot study during the spring migration of fishes from the North Sea into the Wadden Sea and present comparative results from daily fyke catches (20 mm mesh) in the Marsdiep tidal inlet on two locations and results from weekly fish eDNA analyses on three locations, all within 2 km distance. Fish catches did not differ significantly between the two locations, whereas the eDNA composition showed a significant location effect. However, when eDNA analysis was restricted to species that were caught with the fykes, differences among locations became insignificant. Over ten weeks, from late April to early July, presence–absence calls of fishes based on weekly eDNA sampling significantly agreed with calls based on seven days of fyke fishing 1 km westwards. Fish eDNA compositions differed significantly among sample days and months but not between tides. Over the season, patterns in eDNA concentration (12S rRNA gene copies/L) inferred from quantitative PCR and Illumina HiSeq community composition corresponded to patterns in wet mass for the eight most abundant fish species in the fyke (>6 weeks present) despite changes in water temperature and changes in fish size class. Small sandeel and gobies, which are important prey for large fishes and birds, were typically missed with the fyke but contributed up to 25%–40% of the fish eDNA depending on the sample location.",2020,10.1002/edn3.67

However, such community analyses typically are limited by time and effort of sampling, sorting, and identifications, as well as morphological character uncertainty for some taxa, especially at early life stages. Our objective was to evaluate a suite of targeted metabarcode high-throughput sequencing assays to characterize the macroinvertebrate communities (specifically targeting Annelida, Bryozoa, Crustacea, Insecta, and Mollusca) from environmental (e)DNA water samples along 160 km of the Maumee River, OH (a major Lake Erie, Laurentian Great Lakes tributary). Multiple alpha (richness, Shannon Index, and Simpson's Index) and beta (Bray–Curtis and Sørensen dissimilarities) diversity metrics from the metabarcode assays were compared with an Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) metric calculated from traditional morphological sampling surveys conducted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The 15 Maumee River sites varied in their ICI scores (ranging from 4 to 46), with seven sites rated as “poor” or “very poor” and eight scoring “fair” or “good.” Metabarcoding assays yielded greater gamma richness, delineating 181 Operational Taxonomic Units versus 172 taxa from morphology (the latter often limited to family or genus-level identifications). Both datasets supported similar river-wide trends, with comparable gamma, alpha, and beta diversity patterns and community compositions across habitat types and habitat quality scores. Metabarcode assays revealed similar detection of important bioindicator Insecta, but missed most Trichoptera (caddisflies). eDNA identified eight aquatic invasive species on the GLANSIS (Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System) list, including three missed by the morphological surveys (Branchiura sowerbyi, Potamothrix bedoti, and Skistodiaptomus pallidus; with Lophopodella carteri, Faxonius rusticus, Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, and Valvata piscinalis in both datasets).

Kameni; Normandeau, Eric; Bernatchez, Louis",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Conservation of freshwater biodiversity requires being able to track the presence and abundance of entire fish communities. However, studying fish community composition within rivers remains a technical challenge because of high spatial and temporal physico-chemical variability, anthropic activities and connections with other river catchments, which may all contribute to important variations in local ecology and communities. Here, we used environmental DNA metabarcoding to document spatial variation in fish communities at a small geographic scale in a large river system. The study was conducted in the Contrecoeur sector (5.5 km long and approximately 1–1.5 km wide) of the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada), where two water masses with different physico-chemical properties, known as 'brown waters' and 'green waters,' flow in parallel with limited admixing. Water samples were collected during two consecutive days at 53 stations located in both water masses. Using universal PCR MiFish 12S primers, Illumina MiSeq sequencing, and the Barque (www.github.com/enormandeau/barque) eDNA analysis software developed by our group, a total of 67 fish species were detected. PERMANOVA and redundancy analyses (RDA) performed on relative read abundance revealed that each water mass comprised distinct communities that depended on turbidity, depth, and to a lesser extent on the upstream versus downstream position along the study area. eDNA metabarcoding results were compared with those of traditional surveys conducted previously in the sector and up to 40 km upstream of it. As previously reported, higher species diversity was detected by eDNA and with substantially lower sampling effort. Our results represent one of the few studies documenting the potential of eDNA metabarcoding to investigate small-scale variation in 2D spatial patterns of distribution of whole fish communities associated with habitat characteristics within a lotic system.",2020,10.1002/edn3.129
DOBLE_2020_TES,Testing the performance of environmental DNA metabarcoding for surveying highly diverse tropical fish communities: A case study from Lake Tanganyika,"Doble, Christopher J.; Hipperson, Helen; Salzburger, Walter; Horsburgh, Gavin J.; Mwita, Chacha; Murrell, David J.; Day, Julia J.",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Background and Aims Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding provides a highly sensitive method of surveying freshwater fish communities, although studies to date have largely been restricted to temperate ecosystems. Due to limited reference sequence availability and challenges identifying closely related and rare species in diverse tropical ecosystems, the effectiveness of metabarcoding methods for surveying tropical fish communities from eDNA samples remains uncertain. To address this, we applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach to survey Lake Tanganyika's (LT) species-rich littoral fish communities. Materials and Methods As this system contains many closely related species, particularly cichlid fishes, we used four primer sets including a cichlid-specific primer set (Cichlid_CR). A reference database was built for the 12s, 16s, and control region for 358 fish species including over 93% of known cichlids. Results and Discussion In silico and in situ results demonstrated wide variability in the taxonomic resolution of assignments by each primer with the cichlid-specific marker (Cichlid_CR) enabling greater species-level assignments for this highly diverse family. A greater number of non-cichlid teleost species were detected at sites compared to the visual survey data. For cichlid species however, sequencing depth substantially influenced species richness estimates obtained from eDNA samples, with increased depths producing estimates comparable to that obtained from the visual survey data. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of sequencing depth and local reference databases when undertaking metabarcoding studies within diverse ecosystems, as well as demonstrating the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying diverse tropical fish communities, even those containing closely related species within evolutionary radiations.",2020,10.1002/edn3.43
HANDLEY_2019_TEM,Temporal and spatial variation in distribution of fish environmental DNA in England’s largest lake,"Handley, Lori Lawson; Read, Daniel S.; Winfield, Ian J.; Kimbell, Helen; Johnson, Harriet; Li, Jianlong; Hahn, Christoph; Blackman, Rosetta; Wilcox, Rose; Donnelly, Rob; Szitenberg, Amir; Hänfling, Bernd",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Environmental DNA offers great potential as a biodiversity monitoring tool. Previous work has demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding provides reliable information for lake fish monitoring, but important questions remain about temporal and spatial repeatability, which is critical for understanding the ecology of eDNA and developing effective sampling strategies. Here, we carried out comprehensive spatial sampling of England's largest lake, Windermere, during summer and winter to (1) examine repeatability of the method, (2) compare eDNA results with contemporary gill-net survey data, (3) test the hypothesis of greater spatial structure of eDNA in summer compared to winter due to differences in water mixing between seasons, and (4) compare the effectiveness of shore and offshore sampling for species detection. We find broad consistency between the results from three sampling events in terms of species detection and abundance, with eDNA detecting more species than established methods and being significantly correlated with rank abundance determined by long-term data. As predicted, spatial structure was much greater in the summer, reflecting less mixing of eDNA than in the winter. For example Arctic charr, a deep-water species, was only detected in deep, midlake samples in the summer, while littoral or benthic species such as minnow and stickleback were more frequently detected in shore samples. By contrast in winter, the eDNA of these species was more uniformly distributed. This has important implications for design of sampling campaigns, for example, deep-water species could be missed and littoral/benthic species overrepresented by focusing exclusively on shoreline samples collected in the summer.",2019,10.1002/edn3.5

In particular, when applied to Eukaryotes, we are still lacking a rigorous comparison of morphological and NGS-based diversity estimates. In this report, we studied the diversity and the seasonal community turnover of alveolates (Ciliophora and Dinophyceae) in an oligotrophic freshwater lake by SSU amplicon sequencing with NGS as well as by classical morphological analysis. We complemented the morphological analysis by single-cell PCR followed by Sanger sequencing to provide an unambiguous link to the NGS data. We show that NGS and morphological analyses generally capture frequency shifts of abundant taxa over our seasonal samples. The observed incongruencies are probably largely due to rDNA copy number variation among taxa and heterogeneity in the efficiency of cell lysis. Overall, NGS-based amplicon sequencing was superior in detecting rare species. We propose that in the absence of other nuclear markers less susceptible to copy number variation, rDNA-based diversity studies need to be adjusted for confounding effects of copy number variation.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04478.x
MAECHLER_2019_ASS,Assessing different components of diversity across a river network using eDNA,"Mächler, Elvira; Little, Chelsea J.; Wüthrich, Remo; Alther, Roman; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric; Hürlemann, Samuel; Walser, Jean-Claude; Altermatt, Florian",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Assessing individual components of biodiversity, such as local or regional taxon richness, and differences in community composition is a long-standing challenge in ecology. It is especially relevant in spatially structured and diverse ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been suggested as a novel technique to detect taxa and therefore may allow to accurately measure biodiversity. However, we do not yet fully understand the comparability of eDNA-based assessments to classical morphological approaches. We assessed may-, stone-, and caddisfly genera with two contemporary methods, namely eDNA sampling followed by molecular identification and kicknet sampling followed by morphological identification. We sampled 61 sites distributed over a large river network, allowing a comparison of various diversity measures from the catchment to site levels and providing insights into how these measures relate to network properties. We extended our data with historical morphological records of total diversity at the catchment level. At the catchment scale, identification based on eDNA and kicknet samples detected similar proportions of the overall and cumulative historically documented richness (gamma diversity), 42% and 46%, respectively. We detected a good overlap (62%) between genera identified from eDNA and kicknet samples at the regional scale. At the local scale, we found highly congruent values of local taxon richness (alpha diversity) between eDNA and kicknet samples. Richness of eDNA was positively related to discharge, a descriptor of network position, while kicknet was not. Beta diversity, a measure of dissimilarity between sites, was comparable for the two contemporary methods and is driven by species replacement and not by nestedness. Although eDNA approaches are still in their infancy and optimization regarding sampling design and laboratory work is still needed, our results indicate that it can capture different components of diversity, proving its potential utility as a new tool for large sampling campaigns across hitherto understudied complete river catchments.",2019,10.1002/edn3.33

These changes are placing marine coastal invertebrate communities at greater risk, especially in sensitive areas such as commercial ports. Preserving biodiversity is a significant challenge, going far beyond the protection of charismatic species and involving suitable knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of species. Therefore, knowledge of alpha, beta, and gamma biodiversity is of great importance to achieve this objective, particularly when partnered with new cost-effective approaches to monitor biodiversity. Method and results This study compares metabarcoding of COI mitochondrial and 18S rRNA genes from environmental DNA (eDNA) water samples with standard invertebrate species collection methods to document community patterns at multiple spatial scales. Water samples (250 ml) were collected at three different depths within three Canadian Arctic ports: Churchill, MB; Iqaluit, NU; and Deception Bay, QC. From these samples, 202 genera distributed across more than 15 phyla were detected using eDNA metabarcoding, of which only 9%–15% were also identified through species collection at the same sites. Significant differences in taxonomic richness and community composition were observed between eDNA and species collections at both local and regional scales. This study shows that eDNA dispersion in the Arctic Ocean reduces beta diversity in comparison with species collections while emphasizing the importance of pelagic life stages for eDNA detection. Conclusion The study also highlights the potential of eDNA metabarcoding to assess large-scale Arctic marine invertebrate diversity while emphasizing that eDNA and species collection should be considered as complementary tools to provide a more holistic picture of coastal marine invertebrate communities.",2019,10.1002/edn3.35

Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have become a powerful tool for rare or cryptic species detection; however, many eDNA assays offer limited utility for community-level analyses due to their use of species-specific (presence/absence) ‘barcodes’. Metabarcoding methods provide information on entire communities based on sequencing of all taxon-specific barcodes within an eDNA sample. Aims Evaluate measures of fish species detections, community diversity, and estimates of relative abundance based on eDNA metabarcoding and traditional fisheries sampling approaches in the context of fish community characterization and AIS survellience. Materials and Methods In 2016, eight limnologically diverse lakes (surface area range: 13 – 1,728 ha) in Michigan, USA were sampled using a variety of traditional fisheries gears to characterize fish community composition. Environmental DNAs from surface (33 ± 6, mean ± 1 SD) and benthic (14 ± 2) water samples from each lake were isolated and amplified for two metabarcoding markers (mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA loci) using fish-specific primers. Fish species detected within each lake were determined by comparing the sequencing data to a database of sequences from native Michigan fish species and 19 AIS on the Michigan's Watch List. Results Analysis of species accumulation curves indicated multi-locus eDNA metabarcoding assays can enhance species detection capacities and characterize 95% of a fish community in fewer sampling efforts than traditional gear (range: 2 – 62, median: 14). In addition, all AIS detected in traditional gear samples were also detected by eDNA, while some AIS detected by eDNA assays were absent from traditional gear samples. Discussion Results reported here are, in part, driven by the lack of species-selectivity during eDNA sampling events. Given the efficacy of eDNA assays, we suggest multi-locus eDNA metabarcoding assays be implemented in early detection efforts.",2019,10.1002/edn3.38
FERNANDEZ_2019_HOW,"How can eDNA contribute in riverine macroinvertebrate assessment? A metabarcoding approach in the Nalón River (Asturias, Northern Spain)","Fernández, Sara; Rodríguez‐Martínez, Saúl; Martínez, Jose L.; Garcia‐Vazquez, Eva; Ardura, Alba",ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,"Background Bioassessment of rivers is a fundamental method to determine surface water quality. One of the groups most commonly employed as bioindicators of aquatic ecosystems are benthic macroinvertebrates. Their conventional assessment is based on morphological identification and entails several limitations, such as being time-consuming and requires trained experts for taxonomic identification. The use of genetic tools to solve these limitations offers an alternative way to evaluate rivers status. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has increased in recent years for different purposes, but its use in water quality evaluation is yet to be tested. Here, morphological and eDNA based inventories of macroinvertebrates were compared from the same seven sampling sites in the Upper Nalón River Basin (Asturias, Spain). Materials & Methods High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was carried out on DNA from water samples using an Ion Torrent platform. Biotic water quality indices were calculated from morphological and molecular data and compared with independent physico-chemical habitat assessment to validate eDNA based approach. Results Highly positive and significant correlation was found between eDNA metabarcoding and morphological methods (Morphological and eDNA indices, r = 0.798, 5 degrees of freedom d.f., P = 0.031;) and a highly significant negative correlation was found between molecular and habitat quality indices (Stress score & eDNA, ρ = -0.878 and P = 0.009; Stress score & Visual, ρ = -0.949 and P = 0.0002). Discussion The similarity of results from the two approaches and the correlation of eDNA metabarcoding data with the habitat quality indices, suggest that eDNA performs as well as conventional methods for calculating biotic indices in this system, positioning eDNA metabarcoding of macroinvertebrate communities to transform how river bioassessment can be achieved. Conclusion The usefulness of eDNA metabarcoding to assess rivers water quality based on macroinvertebrates assessment has been demonstrated in a dammed river basin.",2019,10.1002/edn3.40

Therefore, DNA barcoding has been increasingly used by non-taxonomists to identify specimens. Here, we studied the community composition of zooplankton in the Belgian part of the North Sea over the course of 1 year. We identified zooplankton using both a traditional approach based on morphological characteristics and by metabarcoding of a 650 bp fragment of the V4-V5 region of the 18S rRNA gene using nanopore sequencing. Using long rDNA sequences, we were able to identify several taxa at the species level, across a broad taxonomic scale. Using both methods, we compared community composition and obtained diversity metrics. Diversity indices were not significantly correlated. Metabarcoding allowed for comparisons of diversity and community composition, but not all groups were successfully sequenced. Additionally, some disparities existed between relative abundances of the most abundant taxa based on traditional counts and those based on sequence reads. Overall, we conclude that for zooplankton samples, metabarcoding is capable of detecting taxa with a higher resolution, regardless of developmental stage of the organism. Combination of molecular and morphological methods results in the highest detection and identification levels of zooplankton.",2021,10.1093/icesjms/fsaa256

However, this method requires the completeness of a reference database (i.e. a list of DNA sequences attached to each species), which is not currently achieved for many taxa and ecosystems. As an alternative, a range of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can be extracted from eDNA metabarcoding. However, the extent to which the diversity of OTUs provided by a limited eDNA sampling effort can predict regional species diversity is unknown. Here, by modelling OTU accumulation curves of eDNA seawater samples across the Coral Triangle, we obtained an asymptote reaching 1531 fish OTUs, while 1611 fish species are recorded in the region. We also accurately predict ( R ² = 0.92) the distribution of species richness among fish families from OTU-based asymptotes.
